How did you come up with the idea for this product? Kids love Minecraft, and kids move around a lot and have access to various computers. The idea for Gameband Minecraft simply came from that, creating an easy and fun way for players to take the game they love with them wherever they go! What makes your product special? Gameband is a unique, high-end, durable Minecraft inspired device; nothing else like it exists. Aside from it allowing Minecrafters to take the game they love with them everywhere they go, its display can be customized, allowing players to create, display and share animations with their friends.

From design to manufacturing, creating a product is both fun and challenging but ultimately seeing the smile on a customer's face when they open the box, or hearing feedback (like how they never take Gameband off!) is what makes it all worthwhile..

Elegant, rugged and functional, Gameband is the ideal gift for any hard core Minecrafter. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Minecraft. Fun. Wearable. How did you come up with the idea for this product? Kids love Minecraft, and kids move around a lot and have access to various computers. The idea for Gameband Minecraft simply came from that, creating an easy and fun way for players to take the game they love with them wherever they go! What makes your product special? Gameband is a unique, high-end, durable Minecraft inspired device; nothing else like it exists. Aside from it allowing Minecrafters to take the game they love with them everywhere they go, its display can be customized, allowing players to create, display and share animations with their friends. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of this startup experience has been seeing the customer's reaction to the final product. From design to manufacturing, creating a product is both fun and challenging but ultimately seeing the smile on a customer's face when they open the box, or hearing feedback (like how they never take Gameband off!) is what makes it all worthwhile..
