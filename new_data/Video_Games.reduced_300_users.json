                "text": "I read all four Harry Potter books when they first came out, I saw the movie less than a week after its release, and I won a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for PC. I read a rather overbearing review that called the game \"mediocre\" and \"suitable for children only.\" So, after six or seven sleepless hours spent playing \"Harry Potter\" here is my verdict (please note that I have not yet completed the game so I cannot comment on end cutscene):<br />Pros:<br />+ Excellent, detailled graphics (textures, lighting, effects) that bring Hogwarts to life<br />+ Cutscenes that preserve most of the suspense and humour from the book/movie<br />+ The game tries to closely mirror important events from the book (Quidditch matches, using the Invisibility Cloak to rescue Norbert, attending Potions, Herbology, and Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, putting Fluffy to sleep, battling Voldemort)<br />+ Character voice acting is above average and characters sound like their movie counterparts (only the Snape voice was a little off--trust me, I know Alan Rickman's voice when I hear it)<br />+ Attention to detail (except that they could have made the images in the pictures move like in the book/movie)<br />+ The Challenges offered a chance to try out new skills/spells and had interesting obstacles<br />+ The characters: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Draco, the professors....all look, act and sound like their book/movie counterparts<br />Cons:<br />- Some sequences are ridiculously easy and then the next minute are impossibly hard--lacks continuity in spots<br />- Some of the tasks are too contrived--i.e. Hagrid's garden caves collecting Fire Seeds<br />- Quidditch controls are very awkward<br />- No background information given, introduction was too little, story skips around in spots<br />- Saves are automatic and in inconvenient spots<br />- No way to adjust difficulty level<br />Final verdict: This is a game worth a look if you liked the Harry Potter books/movie. Has some very good action sequences and beautiful graphics. Medium to hard difficulty level in spots.",

                "text": "\"Grim Fandango\" is the coolest game *ever* even though it was released in 1998. It isn't your average game: from beginning to end you travel for four years through the Land of the Dead. You play as Manuel (Manny) Calavera, travel agent with the DOD (Department of Death) in a city named El Marrow that is an Art Deco, stylized Mexico City of sorts. Your job: to find the woman of your dreams that you accidentally sent packing. Oops. Along the way you have to avoid being sprouted, blown up, decapitated...not an average day's work, amigo.<br />The game incorporates various elements from Mexican/Aztec culture, especially the artwork adorning buildings (the DOD office, the S.S. Lamancha, the temple in Year Four). There are also spoofs in the game of film noir (Casablanca:Manny's casino), Las Vegas-style casinos and neon lights (El Marrow towards the end, Rubacava), hippies (the audience in the Blue Casket, open mic night and phrases like daddy-o, hepcat, and the man), and pretty much everything else thrown in (giant kitty litter boxes, claustrophobia, French waiters, hangovers, romantic tension, gunfights, fistfights, fast cars. Jokes are fast and furious and always hit the mark. \"Grim Fandango\" features the best writing I have ever seen in a game. This seems more like a Tim Burton meets Woody Allen project (think Nightmare Before Christmas): talking skeletons who smoke, drink, gamble and cheat on one another (some that are overly neurotic/paranoid (Chowchilla Charlie), swearing sailors (Toto, Naranja), morbid coroners, deranged florists, femme fatales (Meche, Olivia), perky coatgirls and plenty of baddies.<br />Even though the game is four years old, the 3D graphics still look wonderful, and the cutscenes flow smoothly. Load times were not terrible considering rendering requirements. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing (it can be purchased through LucasArts), covering Mexican mariachi, Andean panpipes, jazz and Spanish-influenced orchestral music.<br />Nothing objectionable violence wise, some mild swearing, a few risqu&eacute; jokes and a disclaimer saying that \"Grim Fandango\" glorifies smoking and alcohol use along with the following: the characters are already dead so it's ok. The most clever, involving, unusual game that I've ever had the pleasure to play, \"Grim Fandango\" has a place of honour in my collection.",

                "text": "&quot;The Longest Journey&quot; is immensely satisfying on a variety of levels: visually, aurally and its ability to tell a most incredible tale. The writing is better than any other game, book, or movie that I have played, seen or read. Ragnar Tornquist's story makes you care about *every* character, from the protagonist April Ryan to the most minor characters, both human and, well, alien.<br />+ Visuals are impressive both in quality and imagination. Panoramic vistas of sea, twisted fantasy landscapes, sleazy future metropolis Newport, bohemian Venice, and medieval Arcadia shine. Cutscenes are movie quality, although playback from my hard drive was choppy at times.<br />+ Sound was excellent, both music and ambient sounds. Background noises were excellent, including nature sounds and the sounds of traffic and city noise. Not much in the way of music but the music matched the moods of the scenes.<br />+ Controls were easy to learn, inventory system was simple and effective<br />+ Cast of characters was large and extremely memorable. Some of my favourites include April, Crow, Charlie, Fiona, Cortez, Captain Nebevay and Burns Flipper (the *extremely* foul-mouthed hacker).<br />- There are no patches available for the US version. I did a full install (over 2 GB) and only encountered one fatal glitch (outside the Newport Police Station) that caused my computer to lock up every time<br />-/+ Full install is over 2 GB but does not require CDs after installation<br />- Objectionable langauge (the two worst offenders are Zack (foul-mouthed mysogynistic border) and Burns Flipper (superfluously foul-mouthed hacker who utters several f-words every sentence)<br />- Game can be wordy in spots (everyone has something to say...a lot of something to say actually) but it is possible to skip dialogue/animations by pressing the esc key<br />+ Good ending, although there are several obvious hints and setups for a sequel. Ragnar Tornquist promises that one day &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; will continue.<br />This is the best adventure game ever in terms of creativity, interest, settings (subways, ships, undersea, outer space), writing, characters and playability.

                "text": "This is the first \"Gabriel Knight\" game that I've played, and I'm definitely looking forward to playing more games in the series. \"GKIII: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned\" had its moments of brilliance.<br />The characters were well developed, with distinct personalities. The voice acting, however, ranged from decent to shame-on-you bad. Case in point: Tim Curry as Gabe Knight. His accent seemed to shift wildly from Southern to...something unidentified. Hall of shame nominee: Scottish thugs proclaiming: \"We're Scots, God help ye!\".<br />The graphics were generally detailed, but pixellated. 3D models had a tendency to cut in and out of the screen.<br />There were plenty of places to explore in the chateau, museum, church, and town of Rennes-le-Chateau, and in the surrounding countryside. The puzzles were often difficult, and I frequently found myself backtracking for missed items. Also, there is a lot of downtime in some of the timeblocks so I found myself wandering around for a while trying to kill time.<br />The storyline was genuinely unlike anything I've ever played before. Although the initial premise is that of a vampire cult kidnapping a child, the ending drastically reinvented the story of Jesus, which is sure to offend many. I *still* don't understand half of the cutscenes and ending months after playing it.<br />There was a lot of dialogue to sort through, and many locations that I had to backtrack through, so this game kept me busy for quite a long time. \"GKIII\" is not for everyone's tastes, hence the M rating. It deals with vampirism and a reinvention of the death of Jesus. It was definitely thought provoking and entertaining, and if you're a fan of mystery and the supernatural then \"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned\" is worth a look.",

                "text": "\"Nancy Drew: The Final Scene\" is the first Nancy Drew game I've had the pleasure to play. After reading so many positive reviews from Amazon.com customers and game magazines alike, I decided that I had to try it for myself. The main attraction of the game for me was the thought of exploring a (dilapidated) vaudeville theatre, a (virtual) pastime of mine.<br />\"The Final Scene\" bears many similarities to one of my all-time favourite games, 1994's \"Are You Afraid Of The Dark: The Tale of Orpheo's Curse.\" Produced by now-extinct Viacom NewMedia, \"The Tale of Orpheo's Curse\" also took place in a condemned vaudeville theatre built in the early 1900s. Both \"Orpheo's Curse\" and \"The Final Scene\" draw heavily on magic tricks and lore. Both theatres are full of faded splendour and faded memories: black-and-white photos of visiting performers, elegant, now-tattered wallpaper, and secret passageways galore.<br />\"The Final Scene\" is gorgeous. Intricate attention to detail, such as spilled popcorn, the texture of a canvas backdrop, and plaster moldings in the lobby really capture the feel of the once-elegant (and fictious) Royal Palladium. Character models are realistic, with good lip-sync and facial expressions. Voice acting is above-average, and the music and sound effects really lend the game a spooky atmosphere: slow, sultry jazz trumpets, creepy organ music, ghostly laughter.<br />The game offers two levels of difficulty: Junior Detective and Senior Detective. The storyline is the same for both games, only the puzzles are harder as a Senior Dective. There is a nifty \"Second Chance\" feature that allows you to start over at the precise moment before you \"died.\" And yes, there are a number of possible deaths facing Nancy if she doesn't solve the mystery or watch her step, including electrocution, a falling box, a falling spotlight, and most terrifying of all, a wrecking ball.<br />Detectives have to carefully gather clues and interrogate suspects. There are four in \"The Final Scene\" :  Joseph Hughes, elderly caretaker of the theatre, Nicholas Falcone, activist with a criminal past, Simone Mueller, power-hungry agent, and Brady Armstrong, teenage heartthrob movie star. Nothing is as it seems, and everyone has some personal involvement in the Royal Palladium.<br />The game begins with Nancy and her friend Maya Nguyen, a student reporter, at the Royal Palladium for the premiere of Brady Armstrong's latest film, \"Vanishing Destiny.\" An appropriate title as it turns out, for Maya vanishes from Brady's (empty) dressing room as Nancy stands outside, helpless.<br />There are plenty of delicious twists and turns, and like Fox Mulder from the X-Files, you must \"trust no one.\" Nancy has three days to track down Maya and her kidnapper before the building is demolished. This includes snooping through personal belongings, making phone calls, and exploring hidden passageways. Nancy also gets to play with some fun equipment. There is plenty of humour, most of it sarcastic on Nancy's part.  \"What's the requests?\" asks Nicholas Falcone, to which Nancy answers, \"Don't you mean...what *are * the requests?\" \"What are you, my freshman English teacher?\" he snaps back,  then asks again, \"What's the requests?\"<br />The side characters are just as memorable, including a spunky 96-year-old Russian woman, Eustacia, with her cat food coupons, who tells Nancy to save her gratitude \"for my funeral.\" There's also a librarian with an accent straight out of  \"Fargo,\" and a bored, Columbo-like detective. Nancy deals with magicians, including Houdini, and young detectives learn several magic tricks along the way.<br />This is a fun, gorgeous, highly addictive game that will keep your young detectives busy for hours.  There are plenty of exciting twists and turns and nooks and crannies to explore, and \"The Final Scene\" is sure to be a crowd pleaser.",

                "text": "\"Escape from Monkey Island\" is the fourth game in the \"Monkey Island\" series, which follow the adventures of wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood and the love of his life, Governor Elaine Marley, as they battle against the evil undead pirate Chuck LeChuck (who just won't stay dead after three games). In \"Escape from Monkey Island\" Guybrush returns from his honeymoon with Elaine to find out that they have been declared dead. Now he must investigate a slimy Australian developer who is buying up all of the Tri-Island area and \"reforming\" the pirates into docile citizens. In the meantime Elaine is running for governor against Charles L. Charles, a suspiciously familiar face. Once again Guybrush gets to rescue the damsel in distress, fight monkeys in Monkey Kombat (a hilarious Mortal Kombat spoof you have to see to believe), and test his wit at Insult Arm Wrestling, as well as downing Groggoccinos from Starbuccaneers and visiting his own theme restaurant Planet Threepwood (sound familiar?), all while trying to find a powerful Voodoo charm, the Ultimate Insult, before the bad guys do.<br />\"EFMI\" is the first game to feature 3D characters, and all of the familiar faces (Guybrush, Elaine, Carla, Otis, Herman) translate well to their new medium. The game's engine is basically an upgraded Grim Fandango GRIME system, but the graphics are gorgeous (and eccentric: the familiar swirly clouds, watercolour stars, nifty maps and gaudy costumes look great). The music is a mysterious blend of Caribbean and sweeping scores worthy of John Williams (steel drums, rowdy pirate music, Muzak in Starbuccaneers and Jambalaya Island (the same theme changes to a minor key once you visit Nuttin Atoll, nice touch) string-driven themes). The voice acting is superb, with Dominic Armato returning as Guybrush, Charity James as Elaine, Earl Boen as LeChuck, Tom Kane (Darwin on \"The Wild Thornberries\"), and Nick Tate as Ozzie. The dialogue is as sharp as any of the previous games (I loved listening to Ozzie Mandrill spouting Australian insults and throwing around Aussie slang at every opportunity), and the storyline is always a surprise. I had a few small technical problems even after installing the patch, but I found workarounds, and other than that the game ran great (it does require 3D acceleration, however). A pleasure from beginning to end, I only hope that there will be more \"Monkey Islands\" in the future!",

                "text": "I eagerly snatched up a copy of French cartoonist Benoît Sokal's \"Amerzone\" a few years ago, an obscure little game with gorgeous graphics and creative critters. I dearly loved \"Amerzone\" because it was unique: following the legacy of a dying explorer to a remote South American country isn't your standard game fare. The problem with \"Amerzone\" was that the game was too short, too easy and there was hardly any music or character interaction. With \"Syberia,\" which was originally intended to be an Amerzone sequel of sorts, many of the problems with \"Amerzone\" have been fixed outright.<br />In \"Syberia\" you play the role of an up-and-coming New York lawyer, Kate Walker, sent to buy out a French toy factory in the Alps. But when Kate arrives in Valadilene, she finds that closing the deal won't be as simple as she thought as Miss Anna, the owner of the factory, has died, and there is a mysterious heir. Kate must journey across countries searching for his identity. Along the way, she rediscovers herself, becoming more assured and independent, a true adventurer.<br />\"Syberia\" indulges in flights of fancy unlike anything I've ever experienced. The plot was a masterpiece of mystery, drama, melodramatic moments, and half-buried family secrets. The graphics are photorealistic, and the animations are some of the best that I've ever seen. The music is lush and haunting, always reflecting the particular country/atmosphere that it was portraying. Words cannot do this fantastic game justice. Play it for yourself, then keep an eye out for the sequel, which is due Fall 2003.<br />Microids is the same company that produced the love-it-or-hate-it \"Road to India.\" Based on every other Amazon.com review except mine, everyone hated it. I loved it, flaws and all, and I think that for a small company in Montr&eacute;al with a smallish budget, Microids did a fantastic job trying to capture the feel of India and come up with a semi-original mystery. It is much easier to critique what a game is missing or lacking than to sit down and produce a game from start to finish, sticking to the plot, deadlines and budget. However, \"Syberia\" is a superior game in every way: the 3D models, voice actors, animations, and the biggest difference is storyline. Where \"Road to India\" lacked much of a plot, \"Syberia\" has a novel-length backstory and plenty of twists and turns.<br />The Good: Everything<br />+ 3D models are extremely realistic, especially in closeup (think Helena Romanski's opera performance---the most haunting thing I will EVER see in a video game OR movie)<br />+ Architecture uses elements from Art Nouveau, Russian Communist-era factories, dilapidated, once elegant seaside resorts, train station/greenhouses...<br />+ Voice acting is superb, especially the cell phone conversations<br />+ Cell phone added a level of real-world plausibility: having Kate's boss calling and nagging you, having to listen to Kate's mom gush about her new boyfriend, talking with your boyfriend, your best friend sharing secrets along with her finds at Bloomingdales...you also use the phone in at least one puzzle to gather information. All together a nice touch.<br />+ Music (haunting, magical and highly addictive)<br />+ Cutscenes played like movies. The flashbacks to WWII were especially well done, as was the intro and the ending (which I found to be magnificent...although the actual end of the game does come very abruptly).<br />+ Characters: Unlike \"Amerzone\" and \"Road to India,\" where there was hardly a soul, in \"Syberia\" there are dozens of characters that you interact with on your journey, all of them interesting and some with quite the personality!<br />+ Story: Highly original, magical, with unexpected twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my office chair<br />+ Creatures: some of the creatures from \"Amerzone\" make a guest appearance, and you will learn quite a bit about mammoths.<br />+ Attending a lecture at Barrockstadt University<br />+ The evolution of Kate Walker's character from a business-minded, uptight lawyer, to an adventurer who comes to care for the company she was going to sell<br />The not-so-good (with this game I can't make myself say \"bad\"):<br />- Occasional crashes<br />- Ending is very abrupt (not the ending cutscene, but simply the ending itself...quite obviously a setup for a sequel and rather a disappointment after all the puzzle-solving<br />- Many puzzles are easy, especially to seasoned gamers<br />- Kate's annoying \"No need to go down there\" and \"No point. The door's locked,\" became incredibly frustrating and irritating after the hundredth time<br />Overall, along with \"The Longest Journey,\" this is the most fantastic game that I've ever had the pleasure to play in terms of graphics, story and presentation. The best game of the year and possibly of all time in my humble opinion.",

                "text": "As any reviewer will tell you, writing reviews is a very personal experience. I was one of the few that found Microïds' \"Road to India\" to be an imaginative and overall pleasing little game (emphasis on little, since it took less than four hours to play through...a crime for the money invested).  Other reviews from online gaming magazines backed me up, giving \"RtI\" scores of 80% and up. However, *ever other Amazon.com reviewer* gave the game two stars or less, and I felt positively guilty that some who read my glowing, five-star review had purchased the game and hated it based solely on my opinion. So, for Microïds' \"Post Mortem \" (distributed in North America by Dreamcatcher Games)  I am trying a new technique: besides my own observations, I'm going to list the review scores from a number of sites that I regularly use to preview and purchase computer games.<br />\"Post Mortem\" is Montréal-based Microïds' newest offering, a grisly tale of murder, betrayal, lust and dark, dark secrets. Let me stress the word dark. This IS NOT a game for sensitive viewers, as there are a number of violent and disturbing images during the course of the game. The visuals themselves are dark and dreary nighttime views of Paris, with a moody jazz soundtrack. The interface is similar to \"Road to India,\" with (occasionally grainy) 360-degree panning. The inventory is a bit tricky to navigate, and the dialogue is easily the weakest point in the game (as well as some of the voice acting). Although there are various responses that can be chosen for a given question, you must eventually choose nearly all the responses before continuing. Nor is there any way to skip through dialogue, which can be a boring pain after the second or third time, which diminishes replay value drastically. Some of the puzzles were trial and error, others were too easy and practically shouted out the answer for themselves (another flaw with Microïds' \"Road to India\" was that the puzzles were waaay too easy (but I still stand by my five-star rating for originality and beautiful visuals, as well as exploring a new country and culture, very much like \"Post Mortem\").<br />The game's psychic premise could have been further explored: you play Gustave MacPherson, an American private investigator living in Paris. Even as a child, you were \"sensitive\" and able to sense and see events, which you explore in your paintings. A beautiful and mysterious woman knocks on the door of your shabby flat and wants you to investigate the murder of her sister and brother-in-law in a posh Paris hotel. The story soon takes an occult twist, leaving McPherson to rely both on good old detective work (including an identity sketch puzzle) and his psychic instincts (mostly used as an excuse to show violent, gruesome flashbacks). As I said earlier, the psychic angle could have been further explored, allowing the player to interact with other characters or sites with McPherson's ability.<br />The game lets you explore 1920's Paris by night, a visual and aural treat never before seen in a game. You visit exotic locations and interview shady characters, all of which have secrets of their own. The psychic approach is a novel idea as well. The game is short, although much longer than \"Road to India,\" offering 15+ hours of gameplay.<br />Why I am awarding \"Post Mortem\" five stars:<br />The Good:<br />+ The graphics. Microïds always makes graphics a strong point, as in \"Amerzone,\" \"Road to India,\" the unparalleled \"Syberia\" and now \"Post Mortem.\" The freedom of movement with 360° panning really lets you feel as if you were in Paris, rather than watching a slideshow of it à la Myst. Characters are very lifelike and expressive, although synching may be off<br />+ The story: although the Templars have been dealt with in other games (\"Gabriel Knight III\"), \"Post Mortem\" makes an effort not to follow in the footsteps of past games with the same subject matter. The private detective angle in the Roaring Twenties, in Paris no less, is refreshing<br />+ The \"Film Noir\" inspiration, evident in the brooding, dark visual style, the sultry jazz music, the seedier dark side of Paris, the femme fatale and the PI<br />+ Legible subtitles. A very big plus for hearing-impaired gamers are the subtitles, which can be left on during gameplay and during cutscenes.<br />+ The locations: cafés, bistros, hotels, abandoned metro stations, houses and flats, a police station<br />+ Spooky, spooky atmosphere combined with Film Noir intrigue...you might not be so trusting of what lurks in the dark after playing this<br />The Bad:<br />- Gruesome subject matter that may not be appropriate for all gamers (over 18, that is, the game has a Mature rating)<br />- Awful lip synchronization<br />- Awkward French-to-English translations and bad voice acting<br />- Dialogue trees can lead you to inquire after already-dead characters and skip ahead<br />- The dialogue (and the fact that it can't be skipped or sped up)<br />- Music loops are too short and repetitive in places, including a \"static radio burst\" in one part of the game that has darn near driven people insane (or turned the music off, whatever came first)<br />- Several really frustrating, unnecessarily time-consuming puzzles<br />- The inventory only lets you cycle through a few items at a time, making it a pain to search for items buried in the pile<br />Ratings from other gaming sites (so you don't have to trust my opinion alone):<br />Adventure Archiv: 81%<br />Action Trip: 88%<br />Four Fat Chicks: Star (Mega Supreme, highest rating)<br />Just Adventure +: B<br />The Armchair Empire: 7.3/10<br />Game Nation: 82%<br />Game Rankings.com: 72%<br />Adventure Gamers: 2 out of 5 stars",

                "text": "\"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" was my second Nancy Drew game (my first was \"The Final Scene.\") The graphics are beautiful, with numerous little details that really made the Victorian mansion come alive. Nancy is staying with a friend and helping her fix up a Victorian mansion that she is going to turn into a B&B, except strange accidents keep happening that delay the grand opening. Is the house really haunted?<br />The only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with \"Treasure in the Royal Tower.\" But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the séance, and the many puzzles. The sound effects were genuinely creepy: one minute you will be walking down the hallway and the sound of a woman crying comes from nowhere. Or you're walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers.<br />There are two levels, junior and senior detective. The puzzles are slightly harder for senior detectives, but the plot is the same. If you get stuck you can call your friends Bess and George for hints. I needed to look online for hints quite a bit since, as I said earlier, I must have missed clues since large parts of the story were missing for me.<br />One of the things that bugged me was the fact that there really weren't many places to explore. You can't leave the house, and you only have access to your room and one other room, the attic, the dining room, parlor, and basement. I was hoping for more rooms/secret passageways to explore. Not having more locations really cut down on the game's length/replayability.<br />Overall, \"Message in a Haunted Mansion\" is a fun outing for detectives: a chance to explore a spooky haunted house, gather clues, learn about Chinese art and writing, and dig up clues about a timeless love story and hidden treasure.",

Out of the four games I've played (\"Final Scene,\" \"Secrets Can Kill,\" \"Message in a Haunted Mansion, \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\"), \"Treasure in the Royal Tower\" had the most satisfying plot, interesting characters, clever dialogue, and the most cool places to explore.<br />Nancy is on vacation at a ski resort in Wisconsin built by an eccentric millionaire. The resort is built to look like a castle, complete with a tower that was imported from a chateau in France. French queen Marie Antoinette used to spend a good deal of time in the tower, and one of the hotel guests believes that the tower holds an important secret that could clear Marie Antoinette's name. When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castle's library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular.<br />The locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancy's room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL. Someone doesn't want you to succeed in your search: you are deliberately trapped in the elevator, hit over the head, and locked outside to freeze to death. Only your quick thinking and detective skills can save Nancy!<br />Buyer Beware:<br />I *loved * this game, but I have to give it only three stars because I had HORRIBLE problems getting the game to run. It would crash constantly in the middle of conversations or leave me stuck at a certain point in a hallway before giving me an error message of \"Invalid CHUNK file.\" I had to restart the game 25-30 times before I could beat it, and it would cause my computer to crash as well.There is no patch available on HerInteractive's website. I changed a number of settings and configurations and the problem didn't go away. The most frustrating thing was that it wouldn't let me beat the game: after the villain revealed their identity, a chase scene was supposed to follow, but the computer would never return control to me and the baddie got away every time. When I selected the \"Second Chance\" feature, the game would inevitably lock up and my computer would crash again. Very, very frustrating.",

                "text": "\"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake\" is the seventh Nancy Drew game from Her Interactive. This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the \"ghost dogs.\" Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself: four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house.<br />Nancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery: ghost dogs or flesh-and-blood ones? There are three suspects: Emily Griffen, owner of Em's Emporium (Moon Lake's general store), Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the \"hauntings,\" and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail (where he died). Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger.<br />As in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if she's not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning shed, and being drowned, so be careful and save often!<br />\"GDoML\" features beautiful graphics of various locations to explore: Mallone's cabin, the woods, several locations on Moon Lake, a cemetery, an underground network of passageways, and a speakeasy. Playing as a Senior Detective, I found that the difficulty level was just about right, however, the woods maze drove me crazy and I had to go online to print off a decent map (the one included in the game didn't help me much). That was by far the most challenging part of the game, since Nancy has to go into the woods a number of times to search for clues, birds, bugs and more. Every screenshot looked the same, and the map had to be brought up each time, with no way to mark Nancy's progress onscreen.<br />One nifty feature was Nancy's PDA, which automatically records clues, phone numbers, and hints. You can also call Sally, a mystery woman connected to the case, and George and Bess if you need clues. Most of the puzzles were of two types: numeric/dials/switches or tasks. There are several dial puzzles, a letter block puzzle, a valve puzzle, and a safe combination to crack. The other three characters will assign Nancy tasks in return for necessary items such as batteries, camouflage gear, sandpaper and a spark plug, including stacking cola cans, finding bait in the woods, taking pictures of birds with a digital camera, and organizing file folders by Roman numerals. Nancy also performs tasks for Sally, such as testing the well water and repairing rotten floorboards. The puzzles in this game seem much more natural and integrated into the gaming environment than in some previous Nancy Drew games. As with previous Nancy Drew games, there is an \"alarm clock\" setting to change from day to night since some tasks (and events) can only be completed then.<br />Graphics were above average and voice work and sounds were above average as well. The ambient nature sounds were very well done (the forest sounds different between day and night, insects droning, individual bird calls, creaking wooden doors and stairs, the ghost dogs). The music was not memorable other than building tension in certain key scenes. The interface is simple: all actions are accomplished with the left mouse button. You can pan around some screens, making it closer to 360º rather than a static environment, but overall the Nancy Drew games are still in a slideshow format. One improvement is characters: in earlier games characters would only have one or two movements and repeat them while talking to Nancy, and the lip-synching was really bad. In \"GDoML,\" at least one character moves very articulately and randomly and characters lip synch much more realistically. The attention to detail makes this game educational as well as fun: in the ranger station there is a computer with files on local wildlife, park regulations, and the history of Moon Lake. Nancy will do a good deal of reading old newspaper clippings and journals. Nearly everything is subtitled for hearing-impaired players (a very nice touch), including sounds, dialogue and cutscenes. One last feature that I appreciated was the short promos for the other six Nancy Drew games in the series and a trailer for the next Nancy Drew game \"The Haunted Carousel.\" Overall this is a nice introduction to the Nancy Drew series from Her Interactive and a fun mystery to solve with plenty of details and creepy moments.

In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancy's nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief.<br />First, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a master's degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curator's office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest.<br />\"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience.<br />This is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. \"Scarlet Hand\" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and \"Scarlet Hand\" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey. Not just for kids, \"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\" is an intelligent, gorgeous mystery with Mexican flavour and intrigue.",

There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.<br />As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in �Deception Island,� including informative �webpages� about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of �Jaws,� and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you�re really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company. And you get to interact with a killer whale as well! Keep up the good work, Her Interactive! (Nancy�s next mystery is �Secret of Shadow Ranch.�)",

                "text": "Montréal-based Microïds and artist Benoît Sokal have teamed up once again to bring us the final chapter to Syberia, a mythical island where mammoths still roam.  In 2002's Syberia (rated Game of the Year), promising New York lawyer Kate Walker traveled to France to oversee a simple factory buyout. The factory owner, Anna Voralberg, had died, and left a mysterious heir--her brain-damaged brother, Hans, who was somewhere deep in the Russian tundra. Kate journeyed across a Europe recovering from the scars of Communism in order to find the heir and be done with it, but along the way she began to care about Hans and his fantastic mechanical creations. The first Syberia ended with Kate jumping aboard the train in Aralbad, leaving her past and journeying towards an unknown future in Hans' quest to reach Syberia.<br />Syberia II picks up at that exact point, with Kate and Hans rocketing along in the snowy wilderness towards Syberia. As in the previous game, there are four worlds to discover: the gloomy border town of Romansbourg, the vast Great North Passage, the Youkol Village and the Last Voyage. Kate revisits Valadilene, Hans' birthplace, in a sepia-toned dream sequence (the haunting music here sounds as if it was composed by Danny Elfman, i.e. haunting chimes, bells and soloists).<br />In addition to Kate, Hans and Oscar (the cowardly automaton train driver), several characters from the first game have cameos here as well. There are multiple new characters to aid Kate on her quest: the spunky orphan Malka, Colonel Emeliov Goupatchev, bartender and surrogate parent Cirkos, a Youkol chief and shaman. There are enemies that threaten to end Kate's quest: the stern Orthodox Patriarch and bumbling villains Igor and Ivan. Animal characters also play an important role in Syberia II: the spirit guardian Harfang, lemmings, man-eating penguins (!), ferocious grizzly bears, and a Youki, a loyal dog-seal hybrid bred by the Youkol people.<br />There are several notable improvements from the first game, including major graphics improvements: reflections in water and glass, ice textures, and uniform fabric and decals; real time snowfall and footstep marks; dynamic lighting and shadows; animated fog; and better in-game animation. The cutscenes are gorgeous and numerous, and can be replayed at any point. The music is as immersive and beautiful as in the first game, and cycles in and out of gameplay. For much of the time the only sounds are of Kate's footsteps, snow gently thudding off branches and roofs, and nature sounds (birds, wind, wolves howling, ice cracking).<br />The puzzles are more organic in nature than the first game and there is more of an action element: Kate must rock climb, scale antennae towers, swing across chasms and outwit attackers (human and animal). An interesting (but unnecessary) subplot involves a detective hired by her employer to hunt Kate down and bring her home. Kate's cell phone, a crucial element in the first Syberia, has several brief appearances, but Kate generally hangs up mid-call (If I were her I would have thrown it off the train!).<br />Syberia II has much more of a spiritual element based on Youkol medicine and shamanism (you must make a Youkol potion, summon a spirit guide, and journey into a spirit world), and the ending ties up storylines from both games. There are several tear-jerker moments in the game.<br />There are optional subtitles for the hearing-impaired, a \"Syberia recap\" that neatly packages the major events of the first game into an entertaining trailer for those not familiar with the Syberia universe, and replay option for cinematic cutscenes. Syberia II is visually stunning, thought-provoking and a more than satisfying sequel that lives up to the impossibly high standards of the first Syberia. Bravo!",

                "text": "Montreal-based Microids, creator of such gems as Amerzone, Syberia, Road to India and Post Mortem, has created its swan song in the form of Still Life:  Microids was recently absorbed by another Montreal producer, UbiSoft, shortly before the game's launch.  Still Life was chosen as Best Adventure Game at the 2004 E3 convention, and it's easy to see why. Based partially on characters from 2003's Post Mortem (psychic painter/ private eye Gustav McPherson), Still Life tracks the parallels between a modern-day serial killer in Chicago and a similar case in Prague 75 years ago.  Gus McPherson's granddaughter Victoria, or Vic, is a profiler with the FBI and has been assigned to work a case in Chicago involving a series of grisly prostitute murders.<br /><br />The game begins with a stunning, fast-paced cinematic that ties together the modern murders with Gus' case in Prague, awash in sinister mood and a haunting choir soundtrack.  Vic begins at the fifth crime scene, where a prostitute is found stabbed and drowned in a condemned building.  Vic's partner, David Miller, is as green as they come, and instead of helping, ends up contaminating crime scenes with, as Vic dubs them, \"Miller's little Martians,\" aka, vomit.  Vic, with the help of her former Quantico professor/ Chicago coroner Claire, is left to piece together the killer's M.O.  Before long, it becomes clear that the killer is baiting her with clues related to her grandfather's case in Prague.<br /><br />The game is divided into seven chapters, split between Vic (modern Chicago) and Gus (1930s Prague).  Microids previously flirted with the concept in Post Mortem, where several chapters were played by a secondary character.  In Still Life, the convention works well: as Vic reads Gus's journal to gain insights into her current case, the narration dissolves into Gus's world in Prague and his dealings with the local police and the prostitutes that he is hired to protect.<br /><br />The visuals in Still Life build on the gorgeous 2D environments of Syberia and Syberia II, although here they are suitably dark, gritty, and occasionally kinky.  Modern Chicago looks like a slightly sinister Frank Lloyd Wright-designed playground, interjected with grimy, rat-infested buildings, run-down campus apartments, and the sterile, functional police headquarters.  Prague is awash in fog effects, run-down buildings, junkyards, and forbidding sewer tunnels.  The game takes place at night, and even the interiors are dark and edgy.  Artwork plays a huge role in the game, so expect to spend a good amount of time scouring in-game paintings as clues to the killer's motivations and the degree of his twisted sexual fantasies.  Some of Gus's earlier paintings from Post Mortem make appearances here as well.<br /><br />The puzzles in Still Life are generally intuitive, with the exception of two of the hardest puzzles I've ever seen in a game: a torturous lock-picking puzzle in Prague, and an \"escape the lasers\" puzzle in Chicago.  For the most part, puzzles are varied, inventory-based (with the exception of several slider puzzles), and not too difficult.  The Chicago portion of the game is reminiscent of CSI, as Vic uses Luminol, fingerprints, and photographs the crime scenes for analysis.  The game's inventory, however, is not so intuitive, and took a good deal of getting used to.<br /><br />About the rating: rated M for Mature, Still Life seems almost an Adults Only title for its extreme violence, sexual portrayals, and mature subject matter, including graphic language from several characters.  One of the Chicago cops borders on an insulting stereotype as he constantly uses the \"F\" word and other vulgarities.  All of the cops, including Vic and her boss, use the \"F\" expletive with each other, and Vic made one comment so bold that it actually made me uncomfortable.  Although there is no sexual footage outright, there is numerous innuendo, especially in the dialogues of the Prague prostitutes and in the S&M (!) club (Vic makes a comment about \"battery operated boyfriends,\" and is hit on several times by a female S&M employee).<br /><br />The most disappointing aspect is that the game's *very* open ending clearly sets up a sequel, although with Microids being absorbed by UbiSoft, it is doubtful that such a sequel will occur.  One interesting experiment involved an online prelude to Still Life; before the game's launch (and currently the page is still available at [...] ), players got to explore Victoria's background and personal life a bit more in-depth, while introduced to a background of the game's characters and storyline.  The online game involved deciphering codes, finding hidden clues in pictures, and cracking a serial killer's riddles.  Even if the Still Life sequel was executed in a similar fashion, i.e., online, it would provide closure for all the hours of gameplay invested without a final answer as to the mysteries of Still Life.<br /><br />Still Life, although violent, is creepy, beautiful, and artistic.  With believable characters, an edgy soundtrack, gorgeous graphics, and a fast-paced, curveball storyline, Still Life was a joy to play.  I can only hope that one day Microids will complete the trilogy begun by Post Mortem and Still Life.",

                "text": "Nancy Drew turns 75 this year, and she's still got her youthful sense of sleuthing... in fact, she's as keen as when she first came out in 1930. In honour of Nancy's 75th birthday, Her Interactive has set Nancy's newest mystery \"Secret of the Old Clock\" in 1930s America before the start of the depression. Nancy drives a sporty blue roadster, listens to jazz records, and talks nervously of the possible Depression, while using expressions such as \"keen,\" \"horsefeathers\" and \"the bee's knees.\" Nancy's first mystery (based on her first two books Secret of the Old Clock and Mystery at Lilac Inn) finds her investigating mysterious happenings at the Lilac Inn. The inn is run by seventeen-year-old orphaned Emily, whose mother died recently, and her guardian Jane Willoughby, but Emily has asked Nancy to come help her. It turns out that she's been hearing things, and various \"accidents\" have occurred. The plot quickly thickens, leaving Nancy to puzzle out an eccentric millionaire and a forged will that has high stakes for all involved: Jim Archer, banker on the edge of ruin, Richard Topham, \"clairvoyant\" who lives in the deceased millionaire's house, Emily and her guardian.<br /><br />As with previous titles, a good deal of puzzle solving is chore related, of the \"I scratch your back, you scratch mine\" mentality. This means that Nancy must complete chores for other characters before she can receive the necessary information (or inventory) to proceed. Some of these are easier than others: arranging pies, catching a 19-inch largemouth bass, finding toys for a children's orphanage, picking up raffle tickets, and sewing a dress (fiendishly hard, and I'm a cross-stitcher!).<br /><br /> This game sees the addition of two new features, both of which I found unnecessarily frustrating: Nancy's blue roadster, which must be filled up with gas and keeping an eye out for flat tires, and money, which Nancy must spend to solve puzzles (miniature golf, purchasing items, etc.). Nancy's initial $3.50 flies by as you constantly refill your gas tank and spend money to purchase items, and the only way to get more money is by delivering telegrams. This is problematic for two reasons: one, your customers don't tip (although there are some very funny characters and in-jokes), and two, you spend more money in gas delivering them than you earn.<br /><br />That's not to say that \"Secret of the Old Clock doesn't have any redeeming features. Clearly, a great deal of historical research went into the creation of the game, from the 1930s slang to the black-and-white photos that represent Titusville's shops, to the Art Deco motifs in the Lilac Inn and the bank. There seems to be much less interaction with characters: you hardly ever see Emily, chat once or twice with Jane and Topham and Jim Archer. The game seemed shorter (and easier) than other titles in the series, but was a welcome departure in terms of style and feel. A special note here for the game's wonderful atmospheric music: a variety of authentic big band swing with muted horns, mixed with \"creepy\" music at key points, really brings the player into the 1930s. One gripe: the character sprites seemed very low-resolution and blurry, and it wasn't just my monitor. A shame, since so much care was taken on backgrounds and animations.<br /><br />Overall, this is a welcome addition to the Nancy Drew series and another fine accomplishment for Her Interactive, one of the most innovative and dedicated gaming companies around. This will be a hit with Nancy Drew fans, although the addition of driving Nancy's roadster makes navigation extra-difficult for younger players, especially later in the game. This keen game is the bee's knees!",

                "text": "Nancy Drew's 13th game finds her full steam ahead in pursuit of the ghostly legend of Jake Hurley. Jake had built a custom train that he and his wife Camille traveled on, but after Camille's mysterious, sudden death aboard the train, Jake, too, disappeared, the train found abandoned with the engineer dead at the wheel. The \"ghost train\" has been restored by socialite Lori Girard, who has invited several celebrities on the maiden voyage: television ghost hunter John Grey, famous historical romance novelist Charleena Purcell, hotshot detective Tino Balducci, Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy, of course. Soon after the train heads towards Copper Gorge, Lori disappears and it's up to Nancy to find out what happened to her. Along the way, clues to Camille's untimely death and Jake's legendary mine surface.<br /><br />The modeling of the train cars is a pleasant departure from previous ND games. Scenery whips by outside the train windows, and you have to hop from train car to train car as the ground speeds by underneath. Chandeliers sway from the motion of the train. There is loving attention to detail in each room: period photographs, stitched samplers, and aged sheet music all create a believable atmosphere. In addition to the train, Nancy has the chance to disembark and explore Copper Gorge, Colorado.<br /><br />There are several gameplay additions from previous ND games, including Nancy's camera cell phone and Frank and Joe Hardy (who have a relatively small role, although you do get to play as the Hardy Boys at one point in the game). Puzzles are creative, with some HerInteractive standards such as the \"make your own sandwich\" standby, but others (such as a music-related puzzle) were a welcome breath of fresh air that built on HerInteractive's solid reputation as a producer of non-violent, girl-friendly games that emphasize creative problem solving. Clues are just obvious enough without giving away answers, strategically placed and cleverly hidden.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the ending a bit weak (too many loose ends for my taste), and the much-hyped Hardy Boys underutilized, but the solid gameplay and gorgeous graphics more than make up for it. A wonderful addition to a groundbreaking line of girls' software, \"Blue Moon Canyon\" is sure to delight.",

Originally titled Lost Paradise, the game traces the journey of amnesiac Ann Smith as she seeks to unravel the mystery of her identity through the fictitious African nation of Maurania. There are four distinct worlds to explore, fantastical creatures, and numerous characters that seek to aid or harm Ann on her quest.<br /><br />I held off on buying Paradise until the official US Patch 1.1 was released (available at Ubisoft.com) after reading numerous critical reviews of the poor design and programming. However, even with the corrections to cursor sensitivity, in-game cutscenes, and other adjustments, the game is still prone to bugs and the occasional crash.<br /><br />If the leopard segments were made crucial to the plot, there would be more reason to include them. As is, allowing the player to choose to exit the non-mandatory leopard stages makes them feel throwaway at best. The realtime graphics also look weak and outdated in comparison to the prerendered environments. The ending is shocking and very, very brief for the frustrated hours of fighting through glitches and bugs. Paradise had the potential to rival Syberia, but due to sloppy, rushed design (if I had to sum up Paradise's gameplay in one word, it would be \"unfinished\"), Sokal didn't deliver on the E3 2005 hype, and the deceptive blurb on the box \"Paradise is poised to be the most exciting adventure release of 2006.\" Even though gamers gripe about setbacks and delays, I would much rather have waited an extra six months to a year for a finished product free of glitches (and more rendered cutscenes en lieu of spotty, jerky puppetlike character animations) that lived up to Sokal's artistic vision.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />+ Graphics<br /><br />+ Music<br /><br />+ Imaginative settings and creatures<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />-Giving away Ann's story from the very beginning doesn't allow the player to discover Ann's motivations as she recovers her memories<br /><br />-The leopard segments don't serve to advance the plot; poor design and implementation ruin the appeal<br /><br />-Bugs, bugs, and more bugs that result in missed clues, endless hotspot clicking, and illogical options<br /><br />- Sloppy  / nonexistent beta testing (only two beta testers listed)<br /><br />- Character animations (instead of rendered cutscenes) are missing crucial objects, so many cutscenes are hard to follow or make no sense<br /><br />-Objects do not appear in characters' hands",

                "text": "I've played every one of Her Interactive's Nancy Drew games, and except for the last two or three, loved all of them. Her Interactive offers pre-teen girls the chance to use brainpower, not firepower, and to pick up various educational tidbits that tie into the games. The graphics and voicework have steadily improved from the very first Nancy Drew game Secrets Can Kill, but the last three games (Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Danger By Design, and Creature of Kapu Cave) have seen some backsliding in tired puzzles, monotonous find-the-object and perform-the-task-to-get-the-needed-object, and the lack of suspense that made games like Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake and Message in a Haunted Mansion great.<br /><br />Creature of Kapu Cave finds Nancy on an assignment in Hawaii, land of swaying palm trees, hula dancers, and pristine beaches....but you'll have to read travel brochures if you want to see any of those things. The \"beach\" in the game is pitifully small and doesn't allow for exploration beyond collecting seashells--and most of the time, you end up going back and forth to the beach to collect the same shell. Nancy is working as an intern for Quigley Kim, an aspiring entomologist. Nancy also investigates a mysterious genius with serious anger-management issues. But where is the mystery? The intrigue? The \"I'm being followed by something creepy\" moments?<br /><br />One nice feature is the ability to switch between Nancy and the Hardy Boys by calling each other on your cell phone. Navigation is done via \"GPS.\" Nice concept, but the animation quickly grew repetitive every time I needed to select another location.<br /><br />Most of your time is spent in the jungle collecting frass. What is frass? To put it delicately...bug poop.  Yes, Nancy spends a frustrating amount of time collecting and analyzing bug poop. Frank and Joe Hardy are undercover, checking up on Big Island Mike and Pua Mapu. Mike runs Big Island Mike's Excursions, a sort of barter economy where you catch fish and make seashell necklaces to earn Big Island Bucks, which can then be traded in for souvenirs, fishing bait, and necklace supplies. Pua is an up-and-coming surf champ. Other than that, there is a noticeable lack of secondary characters and potential suspects.<br /><br />The puzzles are the game's major weak point. Much of the game (at least half) feels like repetitive filler: making necklaces, collecting shells to make more necklaces, playing the annoying arcade game to win stuff to make more necklaces, and sitting around trying to catch fish. There were no \"fun\" puzzles: spending hours sorting through insect parts and bug poop does not count. There is also an optional arcade game, Wiki Tiki, which has the most annoying song ever heard in a video game. The game is based on Paper, Rock, Scissors, and is purely based on what the computer draws. Prizes include shark's teeth, which can be used in more expensive necklaces.<br /><br />Also, there are very few locations to explore, and very restricted movement within those locations. The beach, for example, is about four or five clicks long. You're blocked from continuing down the beach by a fallen tree. This is Hawaii, so more beach to explore would have been nice. The jungle screens all looked the same. Similarly, Kapu Cave offered pretty scenery but little to explore or interact with.<br /><br />Overall, the game felt...empty. The amount of mind-numbing, repetitive filler puzzles added nothing to the overall experience except frustration. The ending held no hint of mystery or a rewarding payoff. I can only hope that the next Nancy Drew title is a return to Her Interactive's glory days.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />+ Voice acting<br /><br />+ Graphics<br /><br />+ Music<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Length (very short)<br /><br />- Weak puzzles (including at least one known bug)<br /><br />- Weak story<br /><br />- Noticeable lack of characters to investigate<br /><br />- Limited locations and restricted freedom of movement<br /><br />- No sense of mystery or suspense<br /><br />- Two words: frass jars",

                "text": "A barrow is an ancient burial ground, often in the form of mounds of earth or with standing stones such as Stonehenge. England is dotted with these ancient sites, labeled as \"tumuli\" on maps. In 18th century England, digging up barrows was a favorite hobby of the educated, resulting in damage of the sites.<br /><br />Cornwall, the southwestern tip of England, has a rich history of barrows. In Barrow Hill, a team of archaeologists is proceeding on a dig of the local barrow that features seven mysterious stones. The barrow has been left undisturbed except for the building of a service station and motel nearby, but once the team begins excavating, an ancient evil is unleashed on the land.  The barrow in the game is based on Looe, Cornwall, and features parallel structures such as an ancient pagan well, barrow, swamp and service station.<br /><br />Creator Matt Clark has put a phenomenal amount of time and energy into doing justice to the barrows and Cornish legends, and as a bonus there is a link to a webpage talking about the history of Cornwall, barrows, and the making of the game (I was expecting something more polished from the blurb on the back of the box). Clark was aided on Barrow Hill by horror master Jonathan Boakes, creator of [[ASIN:B0000A341P Dark Fall: The Journal]] and [[ASIN:B0002BID5Q Dark Fall: Lights Out]].<br /><br />I had difficulties installing this on my Windows XP laptop; I had to try four or five times, as each time I would begin to install, the installer would launch another copy and freeze completely. My perseverance finally paid off, though, and once I'd launched the game, I didn't encounter any bugs, crashes, or freezes.<br /><br />The game begins with a grainy black-and-white film of you driving along the Cornish country roads as night begins to fall. There is a sense of dread as local radio personality Emma Harry talks about the onset of the Autumn Equinox, and dark clouds race ominously across the sky. Suddenly, your car goes dead, and you're stranded in the middle of a dark forest. But are you alone? There are strange rustles and cries from the bushes, and you're certain that something's watching...<br /><br />Barrow Hill is a first-person slideshow similar to Myst in format. You advance one screen at a time (no 360-degree panning here), which can be terrifying when you're crashing through the undergrowth with only a weak battery flashlight to light the darkness. The photorealistic graphics are based on thousands of pictures of the Cornish countryside. The architecture of the few featured buildings shines, from the ruins of an ancient chapel to the worn-down service station. Little touches make each screen come to life, and there are innumerable close-ups of objects just for exploration's sake (which can be confusing at first trying to determine if it's a hotspot or not). Also like Myst, you'll soon discover that Barrow Hill is devoid of people other than yourself and one or two secondary characters that you interact with only briefly. Where has everyone gone? What happened to the archaeological team? Why are there idling cars with no occupants?<br /><br />The sound deserves special mention, as thousands of ambient sounds were recorded in Cornwall to add to the authenticity, including the chirp of the Cornish cricket. The soundtrack is sparse but effective, underscoring moments of danger or discovery. Voice acting is satisfactory, if a bit melodramatic at times.<br /><br />On your quest, you're aided by several high-tech gadgets, including a cell phone, PDA, GPS, and a metal detector. All of these tools play a part in your quest to restore balance to the barrow. There are plenty of well-scattered clues to the nature of your task, informative background reading in the form of pamphlets, diaries, and mock websites, and many locations to explore.<br /><br />The puzzles are inventory-based and generally intuitive. You pick up only what you need to aid you on your quest, and once you've used it, it disappears from inventory. The journals and gadgets left behind by the team give you plenty of fodder to consider your next move. You can die, and if you do, you're placed one step before your fatal mishap.<br /><br />The biggest achievement after the outstanding sound and graphics is the immersive atmosphere of utter dread...although not gory, you constantly feel hunted by the sense that something evil is looking over your shoulder, from creepy voices on disconnected telephones to ominous smoldering piles of ash next to idled vehicles, or the crash of something following you in the pitch-black woods. My only disappointment was in the super-brief ending that didn't seem to resolve much of the detailed storyline that had unfolded throughout the game, but in Barrow Hill it's the journey, not the destination, that counts.",

                "text": "The first in a series of Agatha Christie PC games, And Then There Were None is a solid book-to-PC screen adaptation that faithfully captures the foreboding atmosphere of Ten Little Indians, Dame Agatha's original novel. Ten strangers are invited to a remote British island by their mysterious host U.N. Owen. Once assembled, they are each accused of committing murder, and all are to be put to death as put forth in the children's rhyme (choking, knives, bee sting, drowning....).<br /><br />Numerous changes have been made, the most visible being the addition of an eleventh character, Patrick Narracott. In the original novel, Fred Narracott was the boatman for the original party of ten, but was not present on the island. In the game, his brother Patrick has taken his place at the last minute, and is trapped on the island when his boat is disabled. The other characters are faithful to the original novel, although some of their backstories have been changed or enhanced.<br /><br />Much care has been taken to bring the manor house to life. There are numerous period details, from the 1930s swing music on the radio to the Art Deco light fixtures. Scenes are rendered in superb detail, helping to bring the manor to ominous life. In the original novel (and subsequent film adaptations), And Then There Were None is a locked room mystery; the island was not explored in any great depth, contributing to the claustrophobic feeling. In the game, much of the action takes place on locations across Shipwreck Island. Nearly all of these locations were created for the game and supported by additional in-game subplots. The only downside is the large amount of tedious backtracking to retrieve items as they are needed.<br /><br />Graphics look dated, and some of the character modeling is distorted (Doctor Armstrong looks like he's hiding a plastic rectangle in his mouth in closeups). Cutscenes serve to move the story along. Voice acting is a mixed bag--I kept feeling like Patrick was slipping into an American accent, but on the other hand Ms. Brent's wonderful accent (and appearance) reminded me of Diana Rigg in The Worst Witch. Judge Wargrave was another strong point in terms of voice acting. The music was pleasant, if repetitive.<br /><br />The inventory system is clunky; there is precious little use of many clickable items, so you spend the game lugging around useless objects (although Patrick will object to picking up some items, saying \"I'm no packrat.\"). The developers put a strange amount of research and design into a major red herring (think of a Hitchcock film involing avians). Puzzles in general range from the intuitive to the outrageous (Patrick's solution to a \"thorny\" problem involves a ludicrous chain of events involving goats). The second installment, [[ASIN:B000GCGQ6Y Agatha Christie : Murder on the Orient Express]], has improved upon some of these shortcomings.<br /><br />The game's greatest accomplishment and tribute to Dame Agatha is in its foreboding atmosphere;  sheets of rain and lightning flash outside, dark storm clouds roll low over the island as you walk across it, and waves crash violently on shore.<br /><br />Generally, the additions to the original story work well. There is more of a WWII political atmosphere than in the original novel; there are references to Hitler, Nazis and sympathizers. The ending has been completely rewritten; in fact, there are no fewer than four possible endings (one \"happily ever after\" scenario and three not-so-happy alternatives) and one \"treat\" ending, that of Dame Agatha's original ending read as a voiceover with still renderings.<br /><br />The game also comes with a copy of Dame Agatha's original novel so you can compare the two for yourself. If you haven't read the original novel, I would suggest waiting until after you've finished the game (or better yet, read along as you play). Even though the ending has been rewritten, reading the story first will take away some of the gruesome surprises in store. Overall, this was an enjoyable game with lots of atmosphere and attention to detail.",

                "text": "In the independently developed Scratches, you play as Michael Arthate, a British horror writer who's hard-pressed to finish his sophomore novel. In an attempt to seek inspiration, you arrange to stay at a dilapidated Victorian manner in the English countryside. The next three days will change your life forever. If I had to sum up Scratches in one word, it would be dark. Dark ambiance, dark motivations, dark secrets await you.<br /><br />The game is set in the year 1976, and during the course of your investigations you'll revisit the shocking past of Blackwood Manor. Feverish dreams (or are they reality?) keep you from sleeping, and there are sounds that can't be explained away by creaky old houses. You are drawn deeper and deeper into the mystery of James Blackwood and his misfortunes. The only sound in the manor is the grandfather clock, the squeak of ancient stairs, and your lonely footsteps...until night falls.<br /><br />The game's Argentinian creators Agust&iacute;n Cordes and Alejandro Graziani are horror fanatics, and their devotion to their craft shows in loving homage to Lovecraft and Easter Eggs that poke fun at other adventure games. Scratches truly shines in creating a foreboding (dare I say downright evil??) atmosphere without gore. At times, the horrifying music by Cellar of Rats makes your hair stand on end when you realize that you're not alone. Every small nuance has been seen to, from the reflection of light in cut crystal to the trinkets that line the house. Blackwood Manor is almost an art museum, what with the numerous reproductions of famous paintings. Although the prerendered environments are lush and lifelike, the animations left a lot to be desired, but hey, this is an independent developer's first game, so I'm not going to fault them on that. Like many horror games, there are \"standard\" areas to explore, like a crypt, chapel, greenhouse, cellar and garage (after playing Scratches, you might avoid going into your basement for a while). You may also recognize a familiar name in the credits: Jonathan Boakes, famed creator of [[ASIN:B0000A341P Dark Fall: The Journal]]  and [[ASIN:B0002BID5Q Dark Fall: Lights Out]].<br /><br />Although some reviewers complain that the first third of the game moves very slowly (you are mainly exploring the manor at this point), I found the pacing to be brilliant. Little clues gradually emerge as you scour the house looking for candles on your first night...stacks of old newspapers and faded scraps of paper start to raise questions. You're able to phone several outside sources for help as the game progresses: your friend Jerry, your secretary Barbara, and two other surprise guests that are directly involved in Blackwood Manor's shady past.<br /><br />The puzzles are largely intuitive and inventory-driven (no combination locks or devilish slider puzzles, thank goodness). The inventory management is adequate, but you do acquire a bloated inventory by game's end, with no way to get rid of extra objects.<br /><br />Scratches: Director's Cut features a patch, but I still found mouse performance to be severely laggy on an above-minimum-specs laptop, and a very frustrating lag on opening any doors that resulted in minute-long lockups every time I tried to enter or exit a room. Otherwise, I didn't run into any crashes or other bugs.<br /><br />This is the Director's Cut, which features improved resolution on the prerendered graphics, an alternate ending, and an additional brief chapter called The Final Visit, where you visit Blackwood Manor in the present day shortly before it's to be demolished. If you don't already own Scratches, this is the version to get.<br /><br />Fans of horror and adventure will enjoy Scratches. If you like Scratches, also check out indie [[ASIN:B000088NQB Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle]]. Nucleosys is to be commended on a job well done!",

                "title": "Some improvements over the last few disappointing ND games",
                "text": "I've played all of Her Interactive's Nancy Drew games, and the last several games were a disappointment to me ([[ASIN:B000FW16W4 Nancy Drew: Danger by Design]] and [[ASIN:B000II066M Nancy Drew: The Creature of Kapu Cave]] in particular). Danger by Design at least had a fascinating backstory, but the weak, ridiculous ending ruined any good feelings I might have had. Kapu Cave was just...bland. Boring from beginning to end, there was NO compelling story and the \"puzzles\" were mind-numbing (sorting of bug poop and making endless shell necklaces to earn more money), with nothing \"spooky\" about the \"mystery.\"<br /><br />White Wolf of Icicle Creek is more engaging than the last few Nancy Drew games. This time, Nancy's in the Great White North at a skiing lodge owned by Chantal Moique. Mysterious goings-on like food poisoning, guest injuries, and explosions have been scaring off Chantal's guests. To add to the mystery, a white wolf has been seen (and heard) at the time of many incidents.<br /><br />The cast of suspects includes Ollie, the lodge's handyman, Lou, a college art student from California, Yanni, a champion skier from the Eastern European nation of Freedonia, Bill, a Canadian construction worker who's here to ice fish, and Guadalupe, a mysterious birdwatcher with a secret. As the game progresses, you'll discover hidden secrets and motives about each one through snooping through their personal belongings; after all, Nancy's taken on the job of maid and cook, so you're responsible for housekeeping every day.<br /><br />Which brings me to the first major flaw. Ever since Secret of Shadow Ranch, ND games have featured the annoying (and time-filling) element of \"chores.\" Generally, these seem like things that adults thought would be fun for kids. Generally, these are a nuisance rather than being fun, and White Wolf is no exception. In fact, White Wolf forces you to clean rooms once a day and cook three times a day for the entire game. This is tedious and cuts down on available time to explore, as does a feature from one of the first ND games, [[ASIN:B00005LVWL Nancy Drew Treasure In The Royal Tower]]: the frostbite factor. Every time Nancy goes outside, you have to closely monitor the \"frostbite\" bar at the top of the screen. If Nancy gets too cold, she freezes to death. This also means that she can only be outdoors until around 5 pm every day, forcing you to advance the game to the next day unless you enjoy wandering for hours inside the lodge. Like several earlier games, you use the alarm clock in Nancy's room to advance the game.<br /><br />Since this is the sixteenth ND game, I suppose it's natural that several puzzles feel recycled. Many are easily solvable and intuitive for the most part, except for the most frustrating puzzle I've ever played: Fox and Geese. A board game similar to checkers, you are forced to beat it not once, but three times. Even with a walkthrough, it literally took me several frustrating days. I was so frustrated that I nearly walked away from the game for good.<br /><br />You do get to interact with the white wolf, who helps you to solve several puzzles. This is a definite improvement over befriending the killer whale in [[ASIN:B0000CEM5O Nancy Drew: Danger on Deception Island]], as you can actually give the wolf commands and have her help you solve the mystery. The wolf graphics were generally quite realistic, and game graphics were good overall, especially the outdoors scenes when you're walking through the snowy mountains.<br /><br />I didn't see the villain coming from the clues throughout the game, so Her Interactive did a good job with the \"a-ha\" factor. I felt like there were limited exploration opportunities, which made the game feel claustrophobic at times, particularly since you are trapped indoors at night due to the cold. But there are definite improvements in storytelling and puzzle execution since Kapu Cave, and the next game,[[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]], looks to be one of the best ND games yet.",

                "text": "On Nancy's seventeenth mystery, she's plunged deep into a world of illusions, secret societies, family secrets, and dark magic in New Orleans. Nancy had only planned to visit a friend of a friend while sightseeing the French Quarter, but as fans know, nothing ever goes as planned. Orphan Henry Bolet, a self-styled Goth with dyed black hair, eyeliner, and tattoos, is the sole heir of his only relative, great-uncle Bruno. Bruno was unconventional to say the least: an unmarried dentist, he had a large collection of glass eyes (which Nancy must find throughout the game), domesticated \"pets\" (some more tame than others) that he trained to perform tricks, and he was caretaker of the nearby cemetery, which explains the model cemetery and list of \"residents.\" When Nancy goes to check up on Henry, she's knocked out by a skeleton, and her sleuthing skills kick into high gear as the late Bruno's secrets come to light. He was the last known owner of The Whisperer, a crystal skull from antiquity that is said to give its owner immortality.<br /><br />Bruno's mansion is filled with odd collections of games and books, and the slanting, twisted halls are bathed only in candlelight as the fierce storm has knocked out the electricity. Nancy must solve the mystery of Bruno's death and the location of the Whisperer while battling wasps, poisonous spiders, cranky alligators and other hazards. On this trip, her friend Bess Marvin provides moral (and sleuthing) support in the French Quarter. Reluctant Bess plays an important role and is the key to solving several puzzles; she must dig up clues and interview suspects in order to help the investigation progress. Players switch between Nancy and Bess by calling each other via cell phone.<br /><br />There are several potential suspects in Dr. Bolet's death: his nephew Henry, his housekeeper Renee, (who dabbles in voodoo), Dr. Gilbert Buford (Bruno's best friend and physician), and Lamont, owner of Zeke's curio shop. This may be one of the most complete Nancy Drew titles; there is ample backstory and character development, including appearances from characters in earlier ND games. The plot twists had me thinking I knew who the villain was until the very end, when it turned out I'd been wrong. Also, this ending was a vast improvement over the last three ND games, which featured lackluster endings and villains. Puzzles are varied, including several arcade-style games, musical puzzles (these are closed captioned), riddles, and matching games. I can't think of a single puzzle that qualified as filler. There is plenty to explore outside the mansion, including a mazelike cemetery and garden. My only gripes would be with the underdeveloped mansion (you can only explore five rooms, including Renee's bedroom, an empty spare room (where exactly does Henry sleep??), and the study) and limited exploration of the French Quarter (more variety would have been nice).<br /><br />The graphics are at an all-time high. Lightning flashes and dynamic rain really create an atmosphere of dread. Candles flicker in the gloom. The game starts with a warning to play with the lights off...this isn't because of the scare factor, but rather because the game takes place at night, in the rain, by candlelight. If you try playing with the lights on, you literally won't be able to see. Character animations are fluid and natural. Cutscenes are cinematic. All of these create a feeling of realism unmatched in earlier games. The sound effects are equally impressive, from the different rain sounds (rain on windows, foliage, and rooftops) to the haunting snippets of jazz and foreboding music that fade in and out at random.<br /><br />There is also a great deal of humor present, including nods to earlier games (there are three Easter eggs to discover). One of the puzzles involves finding graveyard denizens via a series of clues which lead to name puns. I was laughing out loud as I finally put two and two together.<br />Some parents may be hesitant to purchase this game because of its focus on death (cemeteries, skeletons) and dark magic (voodoo, spells, magic herbs, curses), but these elements are handled tastefully. There are some genuinely creepy moments (such as a meeting that Bess must infiltrate), but no worse than one would find in a PG halloween movie.<br />This was by far the most entertaining, well-put-together Nancy Drew game that I've had the pleasure to play (and I've played all seventeen numerous times). Let's hope that Her Interactive's return to its former greatness continues on the next title \"The Phantom of Venice.\"",

This is not always successful; characters are more like expressive, oversimplified cartoons, and motions are jerky, but combined with top-notch voicework, this is easily overlooked. Also, the characters' dialogue is recorded in the various languages of each nationality: as American Robert Cath, you will eavesdrop on conversations in various languages (which will appear translated in subtitles, but only for languages that Robert speaks!).<br /><br />Your fellow passengers may not be what they seem; there are hidden deals and dark secrets afoot. The inventory-based puzzles are generally straightforward and intuitive, and the game's small environment eliminates tedious backtracking. The several arcade-style action sequences are not as successful and suffer from slow, jerky controls, meaning that if you die you'll have to play again and again before you can move on.<br /><br />Overall, the combination of detailed backstory, attention to period detail, the many languages and nationalities, the cinematic score, and rich visuals make this a game to treasure.",

                "text": "Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun is AWE Game's third Agatha Christie adaptation for the PC, and as such, has made admirable improvements over its predecessors, with a few small glitches. Based on Dame Agatha's [[ASIN:0425129608 Evil under the Sun (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)]], it is the tale of seemingly unrelated guests vacationing on a nearly-deserted British island early in WWII. However, all is not quiet in this apparent paradise; Arlena Stuart-Marshall, a rich and beautiful actress, turns up dead on an isolated beach, and nearly everyone has some connection either to the murder or the strange goings-on on Seadrift Island.<br /><br />The game opens with the unique premise that Poirot and Hastings are in Poirot's London apartment during an air raid, and in order to distract themselves, Poirot offers to retell the details of his latest case, which received scant publicity due to being upstaged by Hitler. Poirot offers the services of the Finger of Suspicion, a \"magical\" device that helps eliminate suspects if you get stuck. During the tale, Hastings will jump back and forth between Seadrift Island, 1940 and Poirot's London office as the two share details of the case.<br /><br />Unlike the previous AWE game [[ASIN:B000GCGQ6Y Agatha Christie : Murder on the Orient Express]], where you played as Poirot (voiced by David Suchet, the BBC Poirot), in EUtS you play as Poirot's friend Captain Hastings as you retrace Poirot's footsteps leading up the the murder and its investigation. However, your physical appearance is that of Poirot, and your thoughts alternate between Hastings and Poirot as the two banter about clues and suspects. Sound confusing? It is at times. Also, David Suchet didn't reprise his voicework here, deferring to the capable Kevin Delaney instead. However, the time travel / body swap gimmick works, and the clever writing results in comic relief.<br /><br />There are no fewer than twenty possible suspects, and each has their own motive. There is not one, but several crimes unfolding simultaneously, including subplots involving a fascist spy, drug smuggling, past murders, pirate ghosts, hidden treasure, small thefts, and of course, Arlena's murder. Also, Seadrift Island and the Smuggler's Rest hotel are incredibly vast compared to the first Agatha Christie game [[ASIN:B000U8DTW8 Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None]], offering hours of exploration.<br /><br />Graphically, the game is flawless, including the Art Deco hotel details and elaborate period costumes. However, I had to giggle on several occasions at a few of the characters who really, really looked like men in drag, especially during cutscenes. I wondered if that was part of the deception at first, but no. Another graphic improvement was in the game's extensive use of ambient effects such as rolling fog, moving shafts of sunlight, distant waves, and rustling leaves that helped to bring static 2D backgrounds to life. The game's voice acting is generally very good, with the exception of some truly bad German accents, and the music is perfectly tailored to suit the mood. The cinematic cutscenes are beautifully executed, and many times are for comic effect as Poirot's grumpy face is featured in close-up, the crinkling of his eyes expressing his disapproval.<br /><br />The inventory system remains unchanged from previous games, but thankfully, you carry few unnecessary items. Generally, the puzzles are inventory-based and are straightforward, sometimes requiring you to combine items or examine items more closely. Another new twist is the stopwatch; in this game, you time several routes around the island to the scene of the murder to determine whose alibis are sound. There are also numerous documents that are added to Hastings/Poirot's notebook that shed light on past events that are connected to the murder. Poirot also engages in eavesdropping on several occasions, and shadowing shady characters (and ghosts). Another pleasant addition is the use of chemical testing to determine contents of items found in suspects' rooms and at crime scenes.<br /><br />Two small gripes: when testing evidence, the results are delivered automatically, with no chance for trial and error. A little more freedom of experimentation in determining content would have been nice. Similarly, Poirot is required to play darts at one point, and he wins automatically. I was hoping for a little eye-hand coordination practice instead of having the computer do it for me. Also, some players had issues with gameplay crashes and glitches, but the game ran smoothly on my above-specs computer.<br /><br />Overall, this is a welcome addition to an impressive series of games that capture the diabolically clever murder puzzles in Dame Agatha's famed mysteries while bringing bygone eras to vivid life. The touches of humor and vivid environment, combined with the extended gameplay, make this the best entry in the series by far, and fans of murder mysteries and adventure games should definitely add this gem to their collection.",

You take the role of Van Helsing, vampire hunter, on the bloody trail of Count Dracula. The game begins in London, where Van Helsing has just received a letter from Jonathan Harker.<br /><br />Dracula: Origin is plenty dark and gory; the game is rated T, and there's certainly a lot of blood and gore (including graphic torture, mutilation and satanic rituals). The game's locations (London, Vienna, Cairo, Transylvania) sparkle and really add depth to the story; puzzle-wise, you spend a large amount of time in Cairo exploring the market, museum, and several residences. Sadly, the section in Transylvania felt more like a tacked-on afterthought. The ending is super-brief, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Graphics: the prerendered backgrounds are generally very intricately rendered, with period touches (detailed paintings, tapestries, etc.). The character animations are somewhat less successful; Van Helsing's movements are wooden (this is a third-person perspective, so you're watching Van Helsing move *a lot*). The cutscenes are beautiful, though. Lip synching is somewhat off in cutscenes, but it's generally not a distraction. The load screens are more of a watercolor wash instead of rendered (and load times are short).<br /><br />Sound: the background music is generally unobtrusive, with a piano-based score that includes fear-drenched organ and quivering strings from time to time. For some reason, the music in Cairo reminded me strongly of Big Fish's soundtrack to their Blood Ties game. Sound effects are very good. It's obvious that English was the second language; there are some subtitles in particularly that don't mesh with the recorded dialogue. Also, Van Helsing got on my nerves; his melodramatic, gasped \"Closed!\" at finding doors locked was grating.<br /><br />Gameplay: Dracula: Origin is an inventory-based game. You only pick up what you need, and it's generally pretty obvious what goes where (although some solutions are a bit of a stretch). There are several puzzle varieties including decoding, sliders, logic puzzles, and find-the-items. The game leans towards the easy side, with plenty of hand-holding; on many occasions, I longed for a more difficult solution. It would have been nice if two different difficulty levels had been included (beginner and advanced), but I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles.<br /><br />Are there some shortcuts in design and graphics that I found annoying? Yes. But Dracula: Origin looks great, plays well, and is certainly one of the better-looking adventure games to come out recently. Because of its intuitive puzzles, this is a perfect first game for those new to adventure gaming. And fans of vampire lore will find plenty to sink their fangs into as well.",

The protagonist is Father Arno Moriani, a priest sent by the Vatican to investigate a local Transylvanian doctor who is slated for sainthood. But his seemingly simple investigation into the good doctor takes several unpredictable twists, and he soon finds himself plunged headfirst into a world of shadowy vampires, a battle that threatens not only his faith but also his life.<br /><br />The main failing of the game is the *absence* of vampires; you only deal directly with the title character at the very end of a long and tiring journey. The rest of the time, you're researching obscure texts, closely examining artwork, and leafing through hefty tomes of Romanian history that deal with the origins of Dracula, or Vlad Tepes. There are also undercurrents of WWII even though the game is set in 1920 (yep, evil Nazis and bad German accents!). There are only a handful of characters, but the ones you do interact with are generally fleshed out, with unique personalities and solid voicework.<br /><br />The puzzles themselves are some of the better ones I've seen in the last few years; there's a wide variety of strategy board games, locks, word puzzles, and inventory-based puzzles. Phlebotomy takes up a large part of the game; if you're squeamish, you probably won't go for the graphic how-to on drawing your own blood several times (\"now all that's left is to push the needle deep into the vein!\"), or poring over cells under a microscope.  Generally, the solutions are quite obvious, although one of the end puzzles requires careful observation and piecing together clues collected throughout the game. One of the features which could have been better utilized was the Bible passages; whenever your character is stressed out (you'll hear his heart beating loudly), you can flip open the Bible to an underlined passage that is directly related to the situation at hand. This action isn't necessary, however, and could have been made a more central element directly related to protecting Father Arno's faith (and sanity).<br /><br />The graphics are lushly drawn, bringing to life the war-torn village with its bombed-out  buildings. Ghostly howls ricochet down the empty streets. The lushness of Budapest is a direct contrast to war-ravaged Romania, and you visit rural Turkey as well. Character animations are effective, and the cutscenes are downright gorgeous, with a hazy, dreamlike quality (you're able to replay videos through the gallery feature on the main menu). The only disappointment was the ending; after so many hours of research and daring escapes, the final confrontation was brief and disappointing. The end cinematics were great, though, and leave openings for future installments.  Overall, this is a solidly crafted adventure with loads of atmosphere and political intrigue, but sadly, little of the title character.",

                "text": "In Nancy's eighteenth adventure from HerInteractive, Nancy makes good use of her passport in her second international outing, this time to Venice, Italy during Carnevale. Her old friend Prudence Rutherford (first heard from in [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]]) has enlists her to discover the identity of the Phantom, a masked robber who's been making off with priceless antiques. The mysterious Phantom escapes detection, having knowledge of the security systems for each site.<br /><br />Nancy's home base is Prudence's old palazzo, the Ca' Nascosta, now in a sad state of disrepair after Prudence sold it to a penny-pinching, ladder-climbing socialite. Nancy shares a room with Helena Berg, a young German journalist who is in love with Venice and hopes to move there. A British art restorer, Colin Baxter, develops a huge crush on Nancy while working on the Ca' and tries in vain to win her affection.<br /><br />Italian culture is everywhere, and Nancy must even learn some basic Italian in order to participate in an important stakeout. You carry an Italian dictionary, which comes in useful for translating signs and documents. The background audio includes several conversations in Italian, but if you don't speak Italian, these aren't crucial to the game. Many times, characters are simply commenting on the Phantom and his adventures, or about personal events. Also included are several flavors of Italian gelato, the Italian card game Scopa, the various Carnevale masks, and Venetian architecture.<br /><br />Nancy is working with the Guardia di Finanza, Italy's version of the FBI, to track the Phantom. Because it's Carnevale season, there aren't enough officers to tail him, so Nancy is given a PDA with tracking capabilities. There are several possible suspects, including Antonio Fango, the shady IT dealer who works across from Nancy's temporary residence, Enrico Tazza , a member of the Machiano Crime Syndicate and a fence for stolen goods , Colin, who has past secrets to hide, and the mysterious (and ungracious) hostess La Contessa Margherita Fauberg. Nancy has three modes of transportation: on foot (free), via vaporetto (water taxi, free), or by singing gondolier (between five and fifteen euros per trip). The main map is clearly laid out and is easy to navigate.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B0009X6QJM Nancy Drew: Secret Of the Old Clock]], Nancy must earn money in order to purchase items needed in her investigation, including books and costume accessories. You begin the game with 200 Euros, and if you budget very wisely, you won't need extra money (those fashionable shopping trips, gelato cones and singing gondoliers really add up!). If you find yourself running short, there are several ways to earn extra income, including dancing in a nightclub dressed as a slinky black cat (!).I loved the variety of the nightclub dancing, although the character animation was jerky and I would have liked to see Nancy move more than just rotating her wrist in-between moves. From my own experience, you can earn between two to over thirty euros per dance depending on how well you nail the cues (for the hearing-impaired: the dance cues are auditory, but flashing colored lights also tell you which colored button to press).<br /><br />I played the game on the Senior Detective level, which offers fewer step-by-step hints (there's no to-do list, for one) and more difficult puzzles, and the majority of the puzzles were sufficiently intuitive, but still challenging. The graphics are gorgeous as always; in scenes of the canals, visible from your bedroom balcony, the water ripples in real time. If you choose to ride a gondola (the amount varies depending on the gondolier), you're treated to a combination of still photos of Venice and rendered scenery which proves quite effective (along with the various Italian-language serenades taken from Italian opera and popular songs). Unlike some prior greats such as [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]] and [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]], the actual story in \"Phantom of Venice\" is spread a bit thin; the game could have benefitted from one or two additional suspects. But the variety of puzzles, some of which are new to the series (stakeouts, tracking, jewel heists), and the inclusion of Italian culture make up for these shortcomings.",

                "text": "\"Warnings at Waverly Academy\" (WAC) is Nancy Drew's 21st adventure with HerInteractive. In WAC, Nancy goes undercover at Waverly Academy, a posh girls-only boarding school in New York. Some of the girls have been getting threatening notes from \"the Black Cat,\" which are then followed by malicious accidents. Nancy, as Becca Sawyer, has been asked by the school's headmistress to investigate.<br /><br />Unlike the previous installments [[ASIN:B001ANDJJU Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and [[ASIN:B0026EV5FW Nancy Drew: Ransom of the Seven Ships]], there are five characters (suspects) that you have to befriend: Izzy Romero, Mel Corbalis, Leela Yadav, Corine Myers, and Rachel Hubbard. True, the girls fall into somewhat predictable stereotypes (the jock, the Queen Bee, the Goth girl), but they've been given distinct personalities with backstories.<br /><br />The first comparison that springs to mind is the benchmark of Nancy Drew games, [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]]. The game is not nearly as long (or difficult!) as Blackmoor Manor. Other than the fact that both games take place in drafty Gothic buildings, there's really not much in common.<br /><br />The school grounds are compact and make for easy (if limited) exploration. Inside the school, you have access to about ten or so rooms during the course of the game, along with limited space outside. I would have liked to see more areas to explore, particularly outside (there's an inviting-looking gazebo I kept wanting to explore). The puzzles fit well into the storyline. There's some filler in the form of \"you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours\" puzzles; if Nancy wants access to a particular item, she has to do something for another girl first. But these puzzles fit well and are subject-related (a science puzzle, a math problem or two). You're also responsible for working in the school's snack shop (you have to do it at least once a (game) day or you get demerits).  You can die (there's a handy Second Chance feature) or get expelled (say, for pulling the fire alarm, too many noise violations, picking locks, or sneaking out at night), but it's smooth sailing for the most part.<br /><br />Even though Nancy has had plenty of techno-tools in her arsenal in previous games, WAC felt totally current: you keep in touch with the other girls via Twitter, there's mention of MySpace (called URSpace), and part of your job is to help with the school's website. HerInteractive even did a cool \"Watching Waverly\" Twitter soap opera before the game's launch (the Twitter script can be read at  twitter dot com/HerInteractive/watchingwaverly And the school has a \"website\" at warningsatwaverlyacademy dot com (the campus map got my hopes up that it would be explorable).<br /><br />Overall, WAC was short, but fun. You really get a feel for the girls, the school, and the mystery. The historical storyline tied in well with the overall theme. The graphics look great, particularly the character animations (special mention to the modeling of Rachel; I thought I was watching a movie during cutscenes, she was so realistic). The music was perfect without being intrusive. There's a fun Easter Egg that you can find (there's probably more), and references to earlier ND games (including the ever-present Koko Kringles). And there's not much in the way of scare factor, so this is a good choice for younger gamers (much less of an emphasis on the supernatural than Blackmoor or [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]]).",

                "text": "Shadow at the Water's Edge (SAW) is Nancy Drew's 23rd mystery with Her Interactive, and it's one of the most impressive in terms of story, puzzles, and spooky ambience. Nancy is taking a well-deserved vacation at the Ryokan Hiei, a traditional inn in Kyoto, Japan. From the moment Nancy arrives, there are spooky omens, and the Shimizu family isn't very talkative about the family tragedy that hangs over the ryokan. Part of Nancy's job is to teach English through the Japan Teacher Exchange program, so you'll have various homework assignments to grade in the evenings. Because you're teaching all day, the game takes place at night, adding to the creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />Shadow at the Water's Edge is one of the scariest games next to Curse of Blackmoor Manor (note that the game is rated E (10+), so there's no gore or violence, but there are some heart-stopping moments). Various paranormal phenomena follow Nancy as she attempts to discover the secrets hiding inside the ryokan, and these were genuinely scary, since several were still unexplained after the finale. This is also one of the longest Nancy Drew games, with ample opportunity for sleuthing, snooping, and interviewing. You'll have the opportunity to hop on the subway as well as conduct phone interviews in your quest for the truth behind the hauntings.<br /><br />The game designers did a good job on incorporating Japanese culture into the game. You'll find Harajuku-inspired fashion, traditional Japanese gardens, cute cell phone charms, and customizable cell phone avatars that you can assign to your cell contacts (design enough, and you can win an award at the end of the game). I loved the little authentic touches, like the very Japanese hot water heater perched over Yumi's apartment sink. Nancy also has a Japanese-English dictionary to help her translate written items. The in-game music ranges from soothing, traditional Japanese instrumentals to ominous taiko drumming and sudden, eerie starts and stops that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />Gameplay is nonlinear. You can advance the game by setting your cell phone alarm; some actions can only be accomplished at certain times. There are numerous logic puzzles based on Japanese favorites like sudoku, renograms, and nonograms, along with several Japanese cultural lessons offered. If you're not a fan of sudoku and math puzzles, consider yourself warned, as you'll spend most of the game solving a variety of them. This is also one of the more difficult Nancy Drew games; I played the game on the Junior level, and ended up resorting to a walkthrough. Because of the two difficulty levels (Junior and Senior Detective), length of the game and the many opportunities for exploration (including at least three Easter eggs), the replay value is high.<br /><br />The team at Her Interactive obviously listened to fan feedback; gone are the endless list of chores and filler puzzles (you have the option to complete additional puzzles, but aren't required to do so). Nancy actually gets to snoop around...at night. There's a definite sense of danger; you can die, but there's a handy second chance feature. All of the suspects have something to hide; you'll find your opinion constantly changing based on what you unearth in your explorations. The finale (there are two possible endings based on how you react) was satisfying, as was the trailer for the next game in the series. This is the perfect game to play on Halloween and a fine return to form for Her Interactive.",

                "text": "To sum up this game in one word: tedious. That's unfortunate, since there was so much that could have been done with the setting and theme.<br /><br />**First impressions...**<br /><br />The first thing you notice is that the traditional \"Nancy's desk\" intro is gone. So, too, is any sort of exposition; I felt as if I'd just been dropped into the desert with no backstory or idea of what was going on. As you have conversations with the suspects and phone friends, you start to put the pieces together, but that came fairly late in the game for me.<br /><br />Most notably, there are very few settings and few hotspots to interact with. There are really only two main locations, the campsite and the tomb. You can pan around the camp, but despite several close-up shots, there's rarely anything to click on. Some background animations (palm branches waving in the desert wind, perhaps some glowing embers from the campfire, scuttling scarabs) would have done wonders to bring the dig site to life. Inside the main tent, it feels like wasted space. You can't pan, and there's nothing to explore inside the bunks. Even items that seemed like they should be explorable (like a purse left out in the open) aren't clickable. You see shelves in the tent; my first thought was, \"aha, supplies!\" but once again, there's no hotspots. There are several snooping puzzles that require you to go through personal belongings, and as mentioned above, there's hardly anything clickable despite lots of potential \"hotspots\" (a digital camera that I was sure would have incriminating evidence, a voice recorder like the one from SAW, but I couldn't click on either).<br /><br />**Puzzles**<br /><br />The puzzles are tedious; it felt like all I kept doing was finding and translating hieroglyphs. On the Amateur Sleuth level, you can skip all the hieroglyph translation by clicking on the \"quick translate\" button. Even some of the puzzles shamelessly repeat themselves during the course of the game. You're given several archeological tools appropriate for a dig site; it's a shame that the game didn't require you to make more use of them.<br /><br />I kept getting lost in the tunnels. True, you're given a map, but it lacks a \"you are here\" feature, and the tunnels look very similar in some cases. More importantly, there was no sense of foreboding, no sense that Nancy really is being stalked by an otherworldly curse. Nancy debunks the \"curse\" events almost immediately after they happen, which takes away any sense of suspense that would have otherwise been generated. I felt no sense of urgency, no hair standing up on the back of my neck, nothing that seemed creepy/spooky like the yurei in [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]] (watery footprints, ghostly reflections, etc.).<br /><br />The character rendering and animation was generally good, but some of the mannerisms (Dylan's constantly putting his arm behind his head, Abdullah's accent) were grating and repetitive. Two of the character accents were particularly grating; Abdullah sounded like a close cousin of Antonio Banderas channeling Puss in Boots, and Jamila sounded like she just stepped out of a British boarding school (both are supposed to be Egyptian).<br /><br />**Chatting up the suspects**<br /><br />It didn't seem like there were many conversation branches to pursue, and some of the follow-up questions didn't make sense (a character would spend two or three minutes giving an answer, and the next question was \"why are you here?\").<br /><br />Some of the scripted conversations seemed a bit questionable. One involved a crack about the British Empire, and the other involved a scenario that sounded a lot like the Book of Revelation and the Rapture, if you subscribe to that sort of thing. This surprised me, as ND games are generally neutral towards political and religious themes.<br /><br />Character-wise, there seems to be more depth and backstory than in many ND games, and the ending is brilliant; you're never quite sure who the villain is until the very end (shades of Agatha Christie here).<br /><br />**Setting**<br /><br />I feel let down that modern-day Egypt was completely overlooked. Unlike [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] or [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]], where you had traditional foods, games, etc. from Italy and Japan, there's nothing to tie TMB to modern Egypt, only the ancient past. You only deal with hieroglyphs and no modern Arabic. A little of both would have worked wonders. It would have been awesome for Nancy to visit a traditional Cairo souk (market), ride a camel to see the pyramids and Sphynx at Giza (even a cutscene would have sufficed) or have to travel between the dig site and a museum to interview / look for clues. Instead, you're confined to one location with few people to talk to, mostly phone friends, which grew old quickly, but the remoteness of the dig site is a central part of the plot.<br /><br />The problem with TMB is that the temples and Egyptian artifacts lack any kind of context or historical explanation. I would have preferred to see TMB be more like [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]], where Nancy was an intern in a museum. There, the educational games felt natural and I learned a lot at the same time. Another good example of the ancient Egyptian genre is [[ASIN:B0017AJMX8 Dracula Origin]]; it had one part that was set in modern Egypt; there you got to hunt for artifacts in the museum, translate hieroglyphs, and it was actually fun.<br /><br />**The new interface**<br /><br />I thought the new interface worked well and made it easy to access important information. The Hints Hotline was in use almost constantly, since I was frequently stuck (it progressively gives you hints until you have the option to see the full solution; this is done in red font, so you can avoid seeing the complete solution if you choose).<br /><br />Also, I  had some issues with the scrolling text boxes during conversations. The letters on the left-hand side kept getting chopped off, so you'd have to guess at the first letter or two of words. Not a major issue, but a bit annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />There are also phone charms to collect, but these seemed totally out of place in Ancient Egypt. In SAW, when you're in Japan, cell phone charms are all the rage and it makes sense to see them in the game, but it seemed out of place in an Egyptian tomb.<br /><br />**Final verdict:**<br /><br />Since I've always been interested in Egypt, there is some replay value; the graphics are simply gorgeous, and you'll see plenty of familiar names and faces from Ancient Egyptian culture, but if you're looking for edge-of-your seat drama like SAW, sadly Nancy won't find it in Egypt. The plot kind of grew on me as the game progressed, but more explorable areas, particularly above-ground, would have gone a long way to making TMB feel less claustrophobic.<br /><br />The teaser for ND27 looks promising!<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Beautiful graphics<br />+ Music<br />+ Ancient Egyptian culture<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Accents<br />- Lack of hotspots / animation<br />- Lack of areas to explore<br />- Repetitive puzzles",

                "text": "I've played nearly all of the 28 Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive; my favorites of all time were [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]](due to the great creepy voodoo vibe and goth prince Harry), [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] and [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]]. I loved the combination of culture, history, and mystery in these games.<br /><br />In Ghost of Thornton Hall, Nancy is called upon to find Jessalyn Thornton, a missing bride-to-be on Blackrock Island, ancestral home of the Thornton family. Thornton Hall is a dilapidated antebellum mansion flanked by skeletal moss-draped trees and a crypt / graveyard. Like CRY, you'll spend the entire game at night, which means lots of dark lighting (and ambiance). As other reviewers have pointed out, GTH felt a bit like a mashup of [[ASIN:B003BHGWMY Nancy Drew - Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and Legend of the Crystal Skull (missing bride-to-be + lots of time spent in graveyards / crypts).<br /><br />You'll spend much of the game untangling two separate mysteries: piecing together the puzzle of the missing bride-to-be as well as the death of Charlotte Thornton, whose ghost is said to haunt Blackrock Island. Nancy has the chance to interrogate several members of the Thornton family, although I would have liked to see more actual snooping (there's definitely much less snooping than in earlier games...and where do these people sleep / eat since no one apparently has a room at the house?).<br /><br />You're limited to three main locations; I would have liked a couple of extra rooms to explore within Thornton Hall (one humorous random ND moment: there's a tea set where you can make yourself unlimited tea, and then I realized that this was one of the few games without a bathroom!). A few more hotspots would have been nice, too (Jessalyn's purse is on the floor, but you can't explore it. Wait, shouldn't there be some evidence in there??). However, there are lots of animations and unexpected surprises that add some life to the creepy old mansion.<br /><br />SAW and CRY are definitely two of the spookier games in the series, but GTH has a sustained spookiness that pounces when you least expect it. Creepy events happen in every room at any moment, and combined with the eerie music (which has a great vocal / cello soundtrack), keep you on the edge of your seat. For me, the biggest cop-out was the supposed explanation for these at the end of the game...which wouldn't have explained all the sightings anyway. The game was morbid more than scary; there are several surprisingly dark subplots and possible endings for an ND game, and several of the conversations involve some pretty black humor on the part of one character in particular.<br /><br />The puzzles offered sufficient variety, but I would have liked to see more use made of the ghost hunting equipment that Savannah Woodham left for Nancy; it's pretty obvious that the hauntings are off the charts, but you only use it for one puzzle and then you're done (SAW was great about using EVP recorders and the like to try and capture evidence).<br /><br />If you're stuck, you can use the hint feature if you're playing as an Amateur Sleuth. Another cool touch is that there are three possible endings depending on how you play out the final scenario. It was fun playing through all three to see the different endings, which also added replay value. One feature that I liked was that you can instantly see which awards you've earned throughout the course of the game using the new trophy menu display; each time you earn a new award, you'll get a notification (there are A LOT of possible awards this time around, adding to the replay value). And there's FINALLY a feature that lets you fast-forward through conversations, which is especially handy if you're replaying the game.<br /><br />The game's atmosphere, music, graphics and story were great; it's definitely one of the best games from the last couple of years post-SAW, but it still seemed short compared to earlier games like Crystal Skull or Shadow at the Water's Edge. However, if you're a fan of \"spooky\" ND games like Mystery in a Haunted Mansion, Legend of the Crystal Skull or Shadow at the Water's Edge, you'll love Ghost of Thornton Hall!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Plot<br />Graphics<br />Music<br />Creepy atmosphere<br />New features (fast-forward through conversations, new trophy menu)<br />Replay value<br /><br />Cons:<br />Seemed short<br />Could have benefitted from a few extra rooms / locations to explore<br />You spend a lot of time backtracking, especially later in the game<br />Contains some pretty heavy / dark topics for younger players",

If they didn't do this, your voice would sound muffled when you spoke, and may cause you to unwittingly speak louder than you need to, which is what you end up experiencing with these headphones.<br />4/5",

They don't cause motion sickness to me! My family, however, are all fans of video games. I did give this a try though. First, it was easy to download the game.  The design/appearance of the game is fairly stylized and cartoonish. They aren't trying to be realistic as far as the characters go. My husband was the first to play it. There isn't a lot of guidance, so he was just trying it on his own. The game works by using the included gun. He couldn't figure out how to pick up a found weapon. It was too new to find anything online, so he gave up. However, later our 21 year old son played it and he didn't have any problems getting the new weapon. Finally, I gave it a try. It didn't make me feel sick to play, even as I roamed around the ship. I found it was easy to point and shoot. In fact, I thought it was easier to use than the Nitendo Duck Hunt game of many years ago. The game itself is okay. You go around a cruise ship, shooting zombies. There is blood and gore, but since it's cartoonish, it's not too bad.  It did seem a bit repetitive in the short time we played. It seemed to start over at times. Of the three of us, we did enjoy the playtime, but none of us have gone back and played it again. That could be because of busy schedules right now.",

Since the console only comes with 2 controllers, she has been limited to how many friends can play at one time. She's slowly adding controllers and with this one, four of her friends can now play together. It's a wired controller, as are most of the others. The dorm room is small, so the wire isn't that much of a problem. She and her friends like the clear design of this one. It's larger than the original joycons that come with the console but a little smaller than other controllers sold separately. It works well and does what it's supposed to do.",

The cushions on this are firm but in a comfortable way for hours of gaming and not getting a sore spot from them being over tight. I like the clear sides to see the circuits and the white lighting for the power and charging is a nice touch. Also the quick mute button is very convenient!<br /><br />The sound quality is wonderful! The bass does sound a bit distorted though and that's really annoying but when it's not loud it's not noticeable.<br /><br />The USB wireless is absolutely awesome. I have this attached to my computer and it took a couple of attempts to get them to pair correctly but it works every time now. The battery life seems to be quiet lengthy.

                "text": "This LUCIDSOUND LS30 WIRELESS UNIVERSAL GAMING HEADSET delivers crystal clear sound, but I found the headphones to be somewhat uncomfortable after an hour or so.  Perhaps that’s just me—I find most headphones that completely cover the ears to be uncomfortable after a fairly short time.<br /><br />Setting up the headset on my PS4 was something of a challenge.  The instructions are minimal, and it took me a while to figure out that the flat USB “base station” had to be connected via optical cable to the back of the PS4 console, and then plugged into one of the USB ports at the front.  Because there were instructions on how to put both the base station and the headset into pairing mode, I figured they needed to be paired, so I bumbled around until they found each other.  The light on the base station turned solid blue when they were paired.<br /><br />Then I did the really stupid, embarrassing thing:  I plugged the boom microphone into the mobile/Xbox input port, instead of into the oval microphone port.  This error turned the headset completely off, so that when I went into the PS4 settings for audio devices, the choice needed for the input and output device (“USB Headset (LucidSound LS30)”) was missing.  After I unplugged the boom microphone (which activates an internal microphone), the headset showed up in the audio device list, and I was able to complete the setup.  (The headset also shows up in the device list when the boom microphone is plugged into the correct microphone port.)<br /><br />Once the headset was set up, it performed beautifully.  I particularly like the chat volume control on the right earphone, which makes it simple to control the volume. There’s a nice option in the settings that lets you test the microphone volume by speaking into it.<br /><br />This headset also works as a standard headset when connected to a mobile device (using the included audio cable).  I plugged it into an iPad Air2, and the sound for music was pleasing.  It’s worth mentioning that none of the special gaming features work (e.g., the chat volume control I mentioned earlier) with mobile devices, as the headset is actually turned off.<br /><br />Because of the tight fit that makes the headset uncomfortable when I wear it for long stretches, I rate this headset at 4 stars (“I like it” on the official Amazon scale).",

The stand is narrow, but it seems to provide a wide-enough base to hold the PS4 console upright without risk of its tipping over easily.  The stand is a good choice if you want better air circulation for the PS4 console, or if you lack desk or shelf space for storing the PS4 console horizontally.",

It's super easy to install and doesn't need batteries.  It's reasonably comfortable to wear, considering that it consists of a microphone, and one small, on-ear, left earphone attached to a plastic band that goes over the top of the head.  (In my experience, this kind of headset usually begins to hurt after a while). There is a volume/mute switch attached to the cable connecting the headset to the jack plug.<br /><br />The inexpensive headset is primarily intended to enhance the TitanFall role-playing experience through a player's use of &#34;official&#34; equipment.  As the brochure packed inside says:<br /><br />&#34;Marauder Six Four communicator is designed and developed by East Lexington Ironworks and customized to be used by Pilots of the Militia SRS ground and air personnel.  This wearable audio unit allows bi-directional voice communication in a robust but compact enclosure.  Noise canceling ECM field microphone is rated for 110dB (roughly the surface dB threshold of a Vanguard Class Titan drop at 3-5 cubits away) as the pilot will be heard loud and clear even in the most intense situations during an engagement.  SRS Marauder Six Four communicator is compatible with Titan cockpit controllers and will securely fit and adjust to different head gear while it is recommended to use it along with chin strap or helmet attachments for personnel who are equipped with Jump Kits.&#34;",

Fortunately, there are things you can do to reduce the noise--try Googling “silence mechanical keyboard” to find suggestions and videos.<br /><br />The other great thing about this keyboard is that the Razer Synapse app enables you to program the individual keys and the keyboard to get total customization.

The app also lets you change the colors on the backlit keys, as well as how the colors cycle or remain static.<br /><br />My PC has the latest Windows 10 installed (as of September 2018).

Instead the backlighting color is green only, and is subject to software adjustment in overall brightness and contrast only.<br /><br />Second, this keyboard does NOT work with Razer Synapse 3.0, the latest version.  If you already have that version on your Win10 PC, you will need to download Razer Synapse 2.0 (currently 2.21.21.1) to be able to make adjustments via software to the backlighting and the key assignments.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the 2.0 software can’t load the image of the keyboard when you go to the configurations, so it’s hard to program the keys with the software.  Also, having two versions of Razer Synapse on my PC played havoc with my Internet connection when I was connected to Razer Central--different browsers refused to connect to web sites (even Google) on the basis that my connection wasn’t secure, even though the connection had been secure by default.  It had somehow gotten changed so it was NOT secure.<br /><br />Fortunately, it is possible to dim the backlighting with the keyboard alone (FN + F11 or F12).  It is also possible to program some keys with the keyboard alone (see the poorly written quickstart manual packed in the box lid).<br /><br />Third, the backlighting is set to maximum brightness by default, and is annoyingly bright until you figure out how to adjust it.  Something that I did NOT like is that only the numbers and letters on the keys are backlit.  You have to peer at the keys to find the symbols, such as the @ symbol.<br /><br />Fourth and last, the mechanical keys have a nice feel, and make a soft popping sound as you type.  I like the “tactile, clicky” feature very much, but question whether the keyboard is worth the Amazon price (about $66) when the 2.0 software has the problems that it has.  I’d rather put my money down on a keyboard that works with Synapse 3.0.",

However, it isn’t so easy to use.<br /><br />Yes, the mouse DPI sensing can be increased so that the cursor really flies across the monitor display, but the mouse movement doesn’t feel effortless to me.  I have to focus to control the cursor and land on the exact spot I want.  In regular use (not gaming), I end up setting the Mouse to a speed below that of my old wired ASUS mouse, so I’m getting no real benefit from the variable DPI settings.<br /><br />Also, the scrolling wheel always feels loose.  For some reason, I don’t get steady or consistent scrolling from the wheel.  Maybe I just don’t know how to scroll like an expert.<br /><br />The mouse works beautifully as a wireless mouse.  It’s a bit clunky as a wired mouse, because the braided cord is thick and heavy.<br /><br />The Chroma capability is nice--you can set the lighted portions (the Razer symbol on the top and the scrolling wheel) to any color you want, or to set them to cycle through different colors.<br /><br />You need the free Razer Synapse software to set the Chroma colors, and also to program the buttons.

Unfortunately, this fell short of expectations.<br /><br />From the outset, it has a lot going for it: linear switches, full-sized, dedicated media keys, etc. Unfortunately, that is where the good stops.<br /><br />First, the bad. Here are my major issues: First, the sound. When you are typing on this keyboard, it makes a very plasticky and hollow sound (see vid), which I wouldn't expect from a keyboard at this price point. Maybe for a very cheap keyboard, but not at $200+.<br /><br />Next, the software. If you don't use their software, the keyboard is constantly and annoyingly changing colors, which can be quite distracting. The software provides a lot of customizability, such as custom macros, colors/patterns, different profiles etc. Annoyingly, you have to have the software open in order for a given profile to take effect (e.g., after you restart your computer, the keyboard is going crazy with the lights until you reopen the software). Also, there is a 5-10 second lag after changing a setting in the software and it taking effect on the keyboard.<br /><br />The keycaps are glossy, so they show fingerprints, etc. Not my cup of tea, but some people prefer glossy keycaps.<br /><br />The stabilizers are okay (see video). There is a *tiny* bit of rattle on the space/backspace/shift keys, but the hollow/pingy sound may be due to the construction of the keyboard vs. the stabs<br /><br />Onto the good: the linear switches feel smooth. The media keys work well and are satisfying to press. I wish more keyboards had dedicated media keys.<br /><br />The cables are braided and high quality. I appreciate that they came with a Velcro tie to make them easy to wrap and travel.<br /><br />Overall, I would expect much more from a $200+ keyboard.",

He felt the cushion provided comfort against the ear and like the length/placement of the mic/mouthpiece.. he was happy that this was easy to hear dual things at once- players online and video sounds as well.. He said it took him a bit to figure out- But, if the mic is placed in an upright position it becomes mute.. and added bonus once discovered! (I guess this is what instructions are for!)<br />Being he’s a full time student- he usually gets to game in little burst after school and/or, after dinner as his homework allows.. and trust me, he always finds the time to make this happen.. All week long he follows this playing pattern and had no complaints. But, on the weekend he gets a bit more time to play in blocks and these sessions can last longer then just his hour or so, like during the week.. I hate to admit it but, he can kick it on the wknds gaming with his friends or teammates for upwards of 2-3hrs. at a time.. And this was when he complained... He said that the headset felt tight (on either ear) and was causing him a headache.. Which, I realize this may/not be caused by staring at the gamebox and all the action/reaction that comes with that? The only problem with that theory..  he said after he removes the headset for even just a few minutes… Headache completely dissipates??!! Leaving me to think this may be the culprit.. Im not sure if there will be any give to this as it wears in.. and if not, he’ll just have to use this when playing shorter game sessions-<br />As for the sound.. he’s not one that “knows” how incredibly well gaming systems can be heard in.. and I’d just assume keep it that way!! When i inquired about sound quality- he informed me he could hear everything perfectly...?!! (Take that from a 16yr old boy for what it’s worth!)<br /><br />Overall, I’m pleased with this.. it has solved my problem and made him more acutely aware of when I’m trying to communicate with him... As for a headset being user friendly, I feel this is quite decent and feels as if components/construction are of a high quality. Just be aware if you have a bigger head (physical not, arrogance! Or, maybe both..ha!!) this may run a bit tight for those in this category..",

                "text": "This is a total find… I headset for the PS4, made by the manufacture of PS4 itself!! And- you get the brand name product for a great deal.. $29.95.<br /><br />The quality of this system is carried over into this accessory.. and I love the fact, this headset is designed to be compatible with the PS4 gaming system itself- how could it not, it’s made the the same people! Usually, as the parent who’s not sure.. I find myself searching various brands to be sure they’ll actually be compatible with the system- This eliminates that issue and gives the buyer some peace of mind.. it will work for the gaming system and work well!<br />I love the sizing and this has ample stretch to the headset!! My teenage son has a big “fat head!” Not to be mean or facetious but, he does have a larger noggin…So, I love this has the slide to become bigger or, smaller- creating a more comfortable and versatile fit for all. Too many times, my son feels the headset becomes too tight after wearing and it can even give him a tension headache. But, with the ease/convenience of some built-in stretch.. this can keep the head comfortable for a much longer period of time!! The material padding the ear is great- it’s not too thick and feels breathable-  this is quite nice so, we’re in for a longer time does not create a sweaty, prone to bacteria issue! The sound is up to par- made for the gaming system.. they have created a product to enhance their own games- Rainbow six siege sounds fantastic.. or, I’ve been told!! But, we have an “underwater exploration experience” adventure and interactive game- which takes you on varied levels of the ocean and as it does, the music changes to let you know where you’re at.. and just relax in the entire experience.. The headset allows you to hear everything with quality. Best of all- when listening with this headset… For the first time, we heard “underwater bubbles“ that have been there all along- they’ve just never been audible to us before!!<br />Big fat bonus: if, wanting to mute this headset? This is awesome- this has a feature to flip the mic. up into an upright position.. giving the ability to hear but, not be heard!!! Love this and the truth is-like it or not, we sometimes need to talk to our gamers while they’re playing.. instead of them saying something “embarrassing into the mic.,” my child always tried to communicate using hand signals- and he sucked at it!! Well, this makes hand signals... a thing of the past!!<br />So, If looking for a headset to be compatible with your PS4 system this is a great find! You have the peace of mind in both, the compatibility and  quality.. For the price you cannot go wrong and you can feel you’re getting a solid product for the $$.<br /><br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",

                "text": "Yay!! Loving the WAGE headset for the PS4 gaming system..!! I am writing from a mom‘s POV so, sorry to any techie peeps! I realize my knowledge is limited.. if needing specific tech details- a diff. review will prob. be better.<br /><br />***Attn. Moms who need help- this review is for you!! Trust me, by default.. I’ve been in the game accessory buying biz. for far too long and I’ve done it the wrong way more times then, I’ve done it right!! So, when I hit the mark… I like to share and save other mama’s from my plight! Tbh, I wish there was a way for all game items to come with a universal stamp- X1 mark telling us console compatibility bc, Yes!!! I’ve even purchased high $$ items for the wrong dang system in the past..??!! If, you don’t know/understand the gaming world.. buying items can be frustrating! Its like sending a man into the makeup world to get concealer foundation for green undertones with a warm skin tone, in pressed powder + bronzer dusting.. oh, waterproof with acne agent, of course..Am I right- its hard.. ha!<br /><br />•From both the look and feel, Wage is a rocksolid item.. these don't present with a cheap or, skimpiness factor in anyway. These feel sturdy on/off the head- and for any younger players.. it takes away the worry that these may be too dainty/fragile. (I heard skullcandy owned the brand? Not sure if it’s so, but it’s solid enough to be..!?)<br /><br />•The size of the ear cup is bigger and dare I say a bit bulkier (ha! It’s not a beauty contest!) I like this encompasses the entire ear itself, almost like a cup- That way, if gaming in the same room.. it keeps you from having to hear the residual sound seeping out to drive you crazy! As for the gamer- this helps create a nice quality “surround” sound for them. My son lmk.. after using his “broken/old” set for the past few months- this has let him hear sounds in e game.. he didn’t even know existed- it is endorsement x1000 for me!!<br /><br />•These headphones have a cord- why I Like: for any of us without tech. skills.. we don’t need to know how to connect a wireless version. These can truly be- unboxed, plugged in, and BoOm!! Ready to play.. it’s just that easy! I figure when ones gaming, you’re sitting positioned in front of the console anyway so, a cord is not a make or, break for me. When kids need help to set up system and I’m the only one to do it.. I MUST have easy. (If needing extra slack, you can move console closer to you and gain more slack.. so, for us- it works!)<br /><br />•Lastly, I love the mute option!! When mic. is flipped to an upright position, it puts everything on mute- letting you have a conversation with your player, w/o them shushing you.. this way the rest of gaming world doesn’t have to be privy to your chatter!! Apparently, telling your kiddo it’s “bedtime“ is the kiss of death in coolness factor! Flipping the mic. is awesome..<br /><br />•For a price point of $30- you get a quality good sounding headset that is respectable for any gamer.. I’d definitely recommend for anyone with the PS4 system! I hope this info can help your decision mamas.. feel free to let me know!",

For half the price- this provides a working alternative.. for my gaming son, he rates this a solid B!<br /><br />Everything it does is adequate and above. He said there’s no drift which is huge- however.. some of the responses can be a fraction of a second slow and if playing on a team competitively he hates being the weakest link. If the alternative is not playing at all- he’s more than happy to make it work for him! Of course if he had his wishes… He’d choose gaming brand!! He tells me there is most definitely a difference… (for what it’s worth!)<br /><br />One other mention was the nice fit/feel in the hand.. not light weight nor heavy. It has substance with an ergonomic grip to make button use, commands and joystick easy to access…<br /><br />This is a solid plan B… and in a quirky place to deal with supply/demand at least this is an option at $32 vs. $64 it’s exactly 1/2. For a gamer that it’s hard on his controllers like mine.. it seems this is where frustration gets taken out in the game (hmm?!) Im grateful OUBANG provides B level capabilities.

Buzzer gets stuck if not inserted exactly straight and exposed it can “compress” to death. tbh, our is so faint. I think it happened. *Note: you can use generic buzzer/bell if this fails.. (but, with new game you shouldn’t have too.) Bottle base has own built in threads to hold cards but, not exactly straight its gets off track and jams! So aside from quirky container- game is quite fun!!<br /><br />Total truth: we tossed out the categories- it was far easier and included younger people. You can make up our own.. ie, answer must reference a family member, pick a color associated with the word etc. rhyming was fun (but the others.. ehh!) *Just know- game is adaptable!! **Hack: You can also add letter tiles from another banana gram game to allow more words or players.. see, adaptable!<br /><br />A higher price for the few flaws yet, we had fun!!

I love singing and sometimes off key too: game option 1 entails you sing along with prompter to match both crescendo and length -even as an ABBA fan, I realized I really did not know some songs as well as thought - it was challenging!  then the game will rate you.  Now if you want a playback there you can (if you dare!).<br />Option 2 allows you to battle with another singer to see who hit the notes the best!  Great game for parties.<br /><br />I also checked out the on lone option: on writing this review there were ~750 songs and there is a British centric collection (this game was made in the UK), but plenty of songs mainly in the 80's, but also quite a lot of 2006-2009 songs too.  Choices also included some duet songs too (which is another option that is offered on the game).  the songs are saved on your harddrive and a little like the kindle - you can retrieved it as long as you have a log on account (for when you have to replace your playstation console.<br /><br />I thought this game was really well designed.  You only need to buy one disc to access the online option.  I am pleased that they are adding new songs to the collectioin (currently priced at $1.49 - good value given that includes the prompter too).  I also purchased the singstar microphones for PS2, which works perfectly with the game (if you want to save a little money, which is you choice and it is not wireless).",

When I saw this game, I thought it would be a great tie-in and a way to entertain him and his seven year-old cousin. To say it was entertaining is a complete understatement, they loved it.<br /><br />The graphics and game play are great.  It is a challenge for younger kids to grasp all the commands (the game comes with a 20+ page instruction book) but basic game play can be instantly grasped. And like many Wii games, it makes for great social play. That is if you don't mind the fantasy violence that comes in the game.  Also, in our case, where we have boys who have energy levels constantly at a 9 or 10, this game quickly pushed them to 11. It causes crazed game play at times, but they have not gotten out of control and they still talk after playing. Actually, if anything, they talk even more about the game and I have not seen any imitation fighting outside the game.<br /><br />Possibly the best part of the whole experience for us is seeing all the characters from the movies in the game.  Great touch.  Oh, and the parents have gotten plenty of fun out of it too.",

Most times this is just a loose game that is held together just enough to make kids \"need\" more accessories.<br /><br />Well I'll admit I am slightly surprised.  The little altar and figurines work together very nicely, but more importantly the game is playable.  Perhaps the biggest surprise is that your game play and earned enhancements actually stay within the figurines which is pretty cool. So as you build the character, the figurine remembers it.  My kids have a couple of friends with the game and they have brought their figurines to other houses to continue building their characters.<br /><br />The game play itself as I said, is fairly decent.  The controls are very easy to manage and my 10 year old has mastered them pretty quickly.  The one slight turn off for the game is that it is cartoon violent and the animation is a little snarky at times.  I truly wasn't counting on much for game play and this truly went past my expectations.<br /><br />This is not an end all gaming experience, but for tweens it holds up well as a game and a product.  Probably would not appeal to older kids and I am reluctant to let my younger son play the game due to cartoonized, but pervasive violence.",

However it because pretty obvious after just a few minutes of playing that there was not a whole lot of challenge to this game. By the time my two sons solved the game about 3 hours later, they had only been stopped in a level a handful of times.<br /><br />Once they solved the game in the first night (albeit, at three hours, a marathon night of video games) and unlocked all the characters (again three hours) they were told they could go back and collect the coins they missed.  Which took another run through the next night.<br /><br />The game itself is a pretty much a clone of Mario Brothers with side scrolling landscapes with a few tricky sections where you need to figure out the way to get into an area to collect the hidden coins.  There were few unique puzzles to work out to get to the coins or beyond places, but the smurfs seem almost immortal against the monsters in the game.  My kids absolutely loved the game but for one weekend and now it's completed. I guess I expected more gameplay than we received.<br /><br />Find it in the bargain bins, or a very good price to keep the entertainment per dollar spent acceptable.

                "text": "The kids loved this game.  We were planning on trying it out in the evening and after watching YouTube walk through, the kids started without me.  It totally held the attention of our older two kids and the younger two came an went, but watching them play I can see why they loved it so much.  It basically is an RPG where the &#34;dungeon master&#34; role is completely automated.  There is a brilliant system of randomized events in various parts of the game along with prewritten cards that narrate seven narrative legends. Also brilliant is that the whole game runs kind of like a tutorial so you barely need to sit down and read an instruction manual (although we did and did need to reference back a little.)<br /><br />The pieces are cardboard but fantastic both in illustrative details and design.  There are wonderful little 3d elements that come up during the legends, again with amazing little details.  My oldest spent twenty minutes sorting all the pieces and showing me the details.  He also showed me the wonderful system of equipping your character with arms and armor which has quality cardboard  equipment over your character card.<br /><br />All in all, this is an accessibly easy to learn, fun to play, wonderfully collaborative role playing game brought to a board game where no one has to sit out as game master.  Lots of brilliant art and brilliant game design going on here.<br /><br />If there is anything bad I can say about this game, it is that halfway through the first legend in this box, the kids were begging to get the first two games in this series.  I guess that is another sign of success for this game.  It has really captured their imaginations.",

Although I'm a little surprised that that customization is more limited than I thought it would be.<br /><br />The looks are great.  I like the lightness and feel of it when I use it.

I did download the driver and calibrated the control which did help, but the inaccuracy and inability to finely aim has made it kind of useless for this.  We will continue to fight with it, but for now it is not workable for fortnite.

I love the long thin shape of the pad and the way it stretches across their whole desk space.  Both the keyboard and mouse lie on top of this mousepad with plenty of room for the mouse to roam.  But the best thing about the pad is the nice lighted edge that runs around it's outside edge.

                "text": "I bought this game on the day it was released, with very high expectations.<br />I have found that this game is like a blend of two other games -- Dungeon Siege and Arcanum. It has the 3D perspective of DS, with the non-linear storyline and NPC interaction variety of Arcanum. This is an excellent combination for a game as it gives both sides of the house, thinking adventurers and mindless hack'n slashers, something to enjoy.<br />The tutorial at the beginning of the game is useful for learning to navigate and interact with the game and shows the basics of combat, item usage, and leveling up. It does not show everything, which is nice because it leaves the player in a position to learn some things on his/her own.<br />Where I feel NWN falls short is in the quality of the graphics. I was very surprised when I started up the game and the graphics were not up to standard with today's 3D games. More effort went into the actual gameplay, and that's where it should be, but the graphics lack in detail and richness in some places. This becomes especially apparent when interacting with NPCs -- they have no discernable faces!<br />This game requires much of your graphics card, wanting 32-bit color settings (NOTE: the game says it requires 32-bit color, but it runs fine on my system at lower settings). The higher the color depth, the better the game looks (to a point). I ran into an issue with the color depth and NWN wanting to crash -- new video drivers fixed the issue completely.<br />I tried the Aurora Toolkit and was rewarded with a null pointer access and an application crash. I had to use the task manager to rid myself of the application, and have not tried it since. I suspect that the new video drivers fixed this as well...<br />I have not tried the multiplayer capabilities, and therefore cannot comment on it with any degree of fairness. My suspicions, though, suggest that multiplayer is the way to go with this game.<br />This is a fun game that is guaranteed to eat up hours and hours of your precious free time. While not perfect, it's very, very good and is the most complete RPG to date. In spite of the few negatives I have stated in my experiences with NWN, I'm planning to finish the single player game and look for user campaigns. It's worth the time.",

                "title": "Cool ideas meet mediocre implementation",
                "text": "There have been a lot of reviews posted for this game already, and they all seem to share the same basic sentiments: so close, and yet so far... Some are very original, some are just dry repeats of what's already been said. I will try to write this review in such a manner that it adds to the comments made, instead of restating them.<br />I bought this game after checking out the box on the store shelf. That was the only exposure to it that I had at the time. I finished it. Now I'm writing a review...<br />Many of the ideas packed into this game are original and creative, giving a whole new dimension to the gaming experience. The non-linear storyline is especially nice, as it allows you to follow your mood instead of trudging down a straight path with no deviations. This does have some issues, though, due to the implementation. Because you can take any path you choose to get where you need to go, it is very easy to circumvent points in the storyline by stumbling into areas of the map (via random exploring) that you otherwise would not find until much later in the game. This can create some real confusion when you get a quest in your journal, then talk to an/the NPC and IMMEDIATELY the quest is solved. This is a little sloppy -- it would have been better to either kill the quest, or just solve it the moment it is assigned, instead of making you go talk to another NPC.<br />By wandering the map aimlessly, I found places that were never mentioned otherwise but obviously had some significance based on what I found there. I have no idea what I missed or where.<br />The graphics are mediocre. Worse, though, is the very awkward interface. The repetetive actions are a tedium that most players will want to avoid, but alas it is unavoidable in many cases. Even allowing some kind of visual macro facility would have been helpful...<br />Another neat innovation is the intermingling of magic and technology. At one point my character attained some level of mastery in a magic discipline, after which I was repeatedly kicked out of blacksmith shops. Nice touch. There seems to be a little bit of an imbalance in favor of magic, but using technology is still fun and allows the player to try something really interesting in an RPG.<br />Some players are upset about the level-50 cap. Don't be upset about it, level 50 is high enough to finish the game quite easily. If you want to really go beyond that, there's a patch out there that lets you reach level 128, and at that point you're simply wasting your time because you're too powerful.<br />The distribution of new experience points for the player to allocate is one way in which a player can directly manipulate the character. The system seems a bit strange and awkward, giving one point at a time to allocate to one of dozens of options. You need to carefully consider how you allocate your points.<br />I must concur with one of the reviews I read -- this game caters to the male chauvanist pig, to the point of being a little offensive in a couple of areas.<br />Interaction with NPCs usually involves selection of canned statements. These can directly impact the game. This is a good thing. These same statements can be issued over and over and over and over, with no progress. This is a bad thing.<br />One interesting point is that the NPCs can get mad at you, and even leave your party, when you tangle with a game character that the NPCs seem to think is a \"good person\" -- even when said \"good person\" attacks you first. Not good. If you are the instigator, that's one thing. But when you're the victim, having your NPCs go turncoat is unacceptable.<br />So why should you buy this game? Well, you should buy it if you are extremely patient with software that sports poor interfaces, or if you have a lot of free time on your hands and the money's burning a hole in your pocket, or if you just want to try something very different in the RPG genre of games.<br />I give this game 3 stars for its innovations. It's a shame that such creative ideas are so poorly implemented in Arcanum. There are better RPG games out there; don't bother with Arcanum unless you want to experiment with the technology aspects.",

                "text": "I bought this title (hereafter UT2003) the week it was released, with great excitement. I loved the original Unreal Tournament (hereafter UT), and I eagerly looked forward to the new release, as surely it would be even better, right? Perhaps not, after all...<br />Many will love this game, others will be disappointed. Unfortunately, I fall into the latter group. It's a good game, that much is undeniable, but I feel it's not up to the standard set by the original.<br />UT2003 is very demanding on the hardware, expecting a 733+MHz CPU, lots of memory, lots of disk space, and a decent video card. Granted, most of us have it, so the majority of players will not have an issue with it. For those still running a 450MHz PC, time to upgrade if you want to run this one.<br />The basic idea behind UT2003 is just like the original UT -- kill everything that moves and enjoy the splatter of blood and guts. The effects in this game are creative, well thought out, and well implemented. On a 1.8GHz PC, it's fairly smooth.<br />That all said, the graphics are not quite as nice as that from the original UT -- and UT was less demanding on the hardware. The images and clarity of such were better in the old game than the new, and there was much less slowdown when the graphics and action got busy. As an experiment, I loaded 16 players in a single player UT game and 3 in the single player UT2003 game. Hardware was 1.8G CPU, 512 Meg RAM, and 32M video. The UT, with 16, ran noticeably smoother and the graphics were better.<br />Another issue I encountered was in loading a profile. I made a mistake and tried to load a profile twice. UT2003 went into a loop that would not let me get to the task switcher or do anything that would allow me to break the loop. As a result, I had to hit the reset switch. *sigh*<br />Sound, specifically voices, are noticeably worse in UT2003. The voices are a little muffled and hard to understand (they are supposed to sound like intercom transmissions, but even so they are poor). The effects of explosions and gunfire are all right, but still not up to the original standard.<br />Yes, I prefer UT over UT2003, and I will probably just continue to play it instead. In my opinion, it is a better game when it comes to graphics and game speed. The creators of UT2003 made a nice game -- it is unfortunate that it could have been MUCH better.",

                "text": "After completing the official campaign from NWN (hereafter, OC), I was left wanting something more. I was disappointed with the OC in that it was a little too easy -- there were too many opportunities to run back to the temple and stock up, even in the middle of combat situation. As a result, the OC was very unbalanced, although the storyline was good.<br />Shadows of Undrentide (SoU) is *not* a continuation to the OC, but rather is a parallel storyline, taking place at roughly the same time. Completely new characters, completely new setting, completely different storyline (although, roughly the same premise).<br />This expansion pack does not have some of the same flaws as the OC. The game is more balanced, with no teleports in combat situations and limited teleports overall. The puzzles are harder, and the rewards for completing quests are not unbalancing either. Further, SoU adds a few new abilities and character classes, as well as new creatures, that would have been welcome in the OC. This is more along the lines of what the OC *should* have been.<br />SoU is shorter than the OC, and for some that's disappointing. It's also a lot harder and takes more time to wade through, which makes it equal out to about the same amount of investment in time. It takes a good little while to work through the puzzles and side quests, which add positively to the game.<br />One negative -- the game's ending is very anticlimatic. Once you finish the final battle, you are led to a cut scene with a vague ending that is resonant of the &quot;...to be continued...&quot; cliche at the end of a bad movie. In spite of a great game and a wonderful final encounter, the player gets a disappointing epilogue, resulting in &quot;Bummer, what a letdown&quot; instead of &quot;Wow, that was great!&quot;<br />In spite of the ending, I still max the rating for this expansion pack. Had the OC been more on the difficulty level as SoU, the OC would have been great. SoU takes a good game, builds on it and makes it better.",

                "text": "I bought this game based solely on the description on the box. I expected a game that had a trailing camera with good graphics, interesting combat, and an engaging storyline. I came away disappointed.<br /><br />The most disappointing aspect of the game is the combat engine. Instead of a realtime hand-to-hand combat system, combat is turn-based. This in itself is not a problem. However, when engaged in combat, the participants run forward, take a swing, and run back. They take turns doing this until someone drops. The whole scenario comes across almost like a game of turn-based bumper cars.<br /><br />Another issue with combat is the unexpected encounters that occur. In the opening stages of the game, the character must wander about in the woods, and very frequently the travel is interrupted by a message to prepare for combat. Often, that there are enemies nearby is a surprise as they do not show until the battle is joined. This kind of encounter occurs throughout the game.<br /><br />Combat is often imbalanced as well. It is too easy to die.<br /><br />The dialog options are somewhat uninspired as well, and the main character frequently talks to herself when trying to interact with inanimate objects. This is disconcerting, if nothing else.<br /><br />There are good and bad aspects to the graphics. The graphics engine itself is good, and the rendered graphical images are very pretty and inspiring. There is plenty of eye candy in this game for those that like pretty graphics and lots of detail. However, one aspect of the graphics that is frustrating is the changing camera perspective. It switches automatically from a side view to a top-down view depending on area transitions, and in the top-down view it is difficult to tell where the player is going and what is in the surrounding area.<br /><br />The storyline itself is engaging, and the developer did a nice job with it. Some of the side quests leave much to be desired, though, so it is a mixed bag in terms of gameplay.<br /><br />If I had to compare it to other games in the same general genre, I would describe it as a hybrid mix between Dungeon Siege and Arcanum. Unfortunately it borrows a little too heavily from Arcanum's pitfalls.<br /><br />I came away disappointed with this title. It has some good ideas and concepts that have been incorporated into it, but the implementation of those ideas make it less than ideal. Some players may find this game to be a refreshing change from 1st-person style gaming, but I found it to be clunky and awkward. I would recommend this title only to those who want to explore the storyline and are not too concerned about the implementation.",

                "text": "Galactic Civilizations II Ultimate Edition is the latest and best installment of the Galactic Civilizations series, packing in both currently-available expansion packs in addition to the base game. It is a turn-based strategy/conquest game, allowing play to stretch out over days or even weeks. There is a lot to this game, but once you get the hang of how to play this game it is very much worth the time and effort.<br /><br />To be very clear, this is a turn-based game, not a real-time strategy game or a first-person shooter. If turn-based games do not appeal to you, look elsewhere. If you have not played a turn-based game in the past, it is a different experience from most other games on the market in that the planning and strategizing require thinking in a different way, and this style of play is not something everyone enjoys.<br /><br />One of the very first things that a player will notice about this game is that the graphics are absolutely stunning. Stardock put an incredible amount of effort and care into the interface, from the menus to the cut scenes. Everything is smooth, seamless and, well, beautiful.<br /><br />Although the graphics are well-done, the interface is exceptionally complex and busy. The player manages almost every conceivable aspect of the game -  economy and tax rate, research direction and funding, relationships with other civilizations, planetary production, fleet composition, trade and more. It is very easy to get lost in the sheer volume of options available.<br /><br />Gameplay starts with several choices, most importantly race but certainly not the only option. Victory conditions (more on that shortly), universe size, star cluster density, frequency of viable worlds, number of other civilizations, and a few other options are all specified at the start. After making all of these selections, the player gets a single planet, a colony ship, a survey ship and an asteroid miner.<br /><br />Every turn consists of a number of important choices. The player decides how to allocate all of the resources available and takes steps to better their position, with the ultimate goal of meeting the victory conditions specified at the start. This may include exploration of space junk (there is frequently much benefit to doing so), colonization of a new planet, or perhaps cranking up the tax rate. Once all of the desired options have been selected, the player ends the turn and a new turn begins after all selections have been executed.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of the game is in designing new ships for the fleet. The player gets to pick hull type, armament, sensors and everything else a ship needs to be a successful contributor. Once a design is complete and named, any starport orbiting the player's planets can build those ships. It is important to keep in mind that some designs may not work well through the entire game but that sometimes a design should be retired in favor of new, more advanced designs.<br /><br />Gameplay continues until victory conditions are met. There are several conditions that can be specified - military conquest, diplomatic victory (peace treaties with all other major civilizations), technological victory (done through research) or even a cultural invasion.<br /><br />Every choice a player makes affects something else within the game. For example, higher taxes can cause a planet to mutiny and join a different civilization. More important, though, is how choices affect relations with the other civilizations. Most civilizations pay attention to ethical alignment and military might, and depending on how strong or weak a player's civilization can even incite a war. Finding a good balance is the key, and finding that balance is inherently tough.<br /><br />As this version comes with both expansion packs, there are three campaigns that are available for play. I have not tried any of these so I cannot really comment on them.<br /><br />This is a very engrossing game with slick graphics and many, many choices for the gamer who wants absolute control over every aspect of the game. If this style of play is appealing to you, seriously consider picking up a copy for yourself and say goodbye to your free time.",

                "title": "Good upgrade from previous versions",
                "text": "Fritz is arguably the most commercially-successful and popular chess package available. I started using Fritz at version 6 and have purchased most of the upgrades, up to version 10. With each successive version the whole package has gotten better and better though some of the upgrades were more worthwhile than others (one reason I never purchased version 11). Version 12 is a quantum leap forward, though it is still not perfect.<br /><br />Installation from the DVD was painless and uneventful. However, there is one issue with the installation that bothered me - the installer never installed a desktop icon or a program group, so I needed to navigate to the installation directory, from which I made a shortcut to the application binary on the desktop. After this step, everything has worked smoothly and I can launch the application without issue.<br /><br />The interface has gotten a huge facelift - this is not a color scheme change or rearrangement of the menus and toolbars, but rather it is a complete overhaul with Windows ribbon controls serving up the components. Normally, I would be wary of such a large change to the overall interface, but ChessBase has done an excellent job of designing the interface and it is very well-organized. There is a learning curve, though, for people who have grown very accustomed to the older ChessBase interface, as some things are a little difficult to find unless you have familiarity... Given a couple of hours of exploration, the interface becomes second nature and finding things becomes easy again.<br /><br />The Fritz engine itself is a strong one, able to crush practically any human player (including seasoned grandmasters) with ease when used at full playing strength and it holds its own against other top-drawer engines. It is not the strongest engine available, but for the vast majority of players it doesn't need to be the strongest. When using an engine this strong, playing against it is not the most useful activity; where engines of this strength are most useful is in the analysis of games.<br /><br />Fritz includes several analysis modes, my favorite being full analysis for post-mortem scrutiny of games. The full analysis function works backward through a game and adds move suggestions as well as canned commentary as the selected chess engine evaluates each position. Though the English commentary is not always especially informative (for example, comments like \"This is a futile try to save the game\" are common), the comments do add a more \"personal\" touch to the analysis which would otherwise be simply a dump of suggested moves. When the engine finds an especially good move, the commentary is usually a little more helpful.<br /><br />I found an annoying glitch with the Full Analysis mode. After fully analyzing a game, the interface simply chopped the last quarter of the game from the report, even though I could still iterate through all of the moves. I never could get the rest of the analysis on the screen.<br /><br />Another very helpful analysis mode is \"Infinite Analysis\" which takes a single position and continuously analyzes it until the engine is interrupted or the position is changed. This is especially helpful for taking a deep look at a position and trying several what-if scenarios.<br /><br />Deep position analysis is another mode, as is Monte Carlo, though I have used these so little that I cannot really comment on them.<br /><br />The last analysis mode I will talk about is \"Engine Shootout\" which takes a position and feeds it to two or more engines for analysis. These engines evaluate the position and play through, with the intent of determining how the game would proceed and the outcome as a result. Though it's a feature I really don't need, it is something I use occasionally to look at games I have played when the game was unfinished but the outcome wasn't clear. Different engines arrive at different conclusions which makes this even more intriguing.<br /><br />The Fritz package includes a large database of games, which can be used to explore and analyze. Where I find this database to be most useful is in researching specific styles of play. For example, it is easy to track down all of Tal's games and follow his playing style with the database search functions.<br /><br />Also included on the DVD is a set of training videos. To be honest I have never found these to be especially helpful but others may very well benefit from them.<br /><br />The UCI interface continues to improve, so adding in UCI engines is easy and reliable. I have found several weaker engines against which I can play so I have them bound into the interface for playing. I use the Fritz 12 engine for analysis after the fact.<br /><br />Central to the Fritz interface is access to the ChessBase chess server. Through the interface, players can log into the server, play games, read chess-related news, watch seminars, and observe important matches with live coverage.<br /><br />There are a couple of different versions to this package. The version sold by ChessBase and its resellers sports a green box whereas the version sold through Viva Media comes in a black box. I noticed an appreciable price difference and I investigated that difference. The software appears to be the same; the real difference is in the access given to the chess server. The more expensive package offers a 1-year premium membership which gives access to all content on the server such as seminars, elite tournament coverage and other content. The less expensive package also offers a 1-year membership but the access is more limited and excludes much of the premium content. Both offer guest access which allows anyone to log in and play games without hindrance, but as a guest so there is no tracking of progress. Which kind of access you desire should be considered when choosing which package you need.<br /><br />Fritz 12 is a big step forward and is a worthwhile upgrade from previous versions. The engine is stronger and the interface is vastly superior. It is not without its glitches but the problems seem to be few in number.",

I have a teenage son who plays cooperative games on-line with a friend of his and so I let him use them for that purpose. It took very little time for these to show their strengths.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed with them is that they are very comfortable. The padding is soft and the cans fit over the ear so there is no pressure on the ear itself. They can be worn for a good period of time without fatigue. The shape of the headphones themselves looks a little odd and as such I was a little concerned that the fit would be off, but this ended up being a non-issue.<br /><br />We plugged them into the computer and immediately they lit up. I mean, there are lights on these things and when powered through the USB port they illuminate nicely. They look cool when they’re lit and the lights are not super bright so this is not a bad thing.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good. We decided to test them out with some music tracks that have a good range of sound and the headphones managed to give us good reproduction of sound without distortion and without overdriving the highs or lows. These are not quite audiophile quality but they are better than a lot of more expensive headphones I have used. The detail is there too so there should be no problem hearing more subtle sounds without cranking the volume too high.<br /><br />The microphone itself is a little tricky to attach but if one pays attention when trying to attach it, it is not all that difficult. Once connected, it works very well and the noise-canceling aspect of the microphone itself helps to eliminate some of the background noise. The result is a fairly clear transmission of sound.<br /><br />The cord has three plugs on it: one for the USB power, one for microphone in and one for headphone out. It’s a nice, long cord too, so range of motion is not restrictive.<br /><br />So far I can’t find too much wrong with this headset. The sound quality is great, it seems to be well constructed and the price is not prohibitive. This is a solid offering the midrange of gaming headsets, and it’s definitely worth a look.",

His requirements are simple but pointed – it needs to be fast, it needs to be comfortable in his hand, and it cannot hesitate or skip. For him, this mouse fits the bill nicely and it has worked out for him. For me, I have found that it is slightly awkward to use. To summarize in a single sentence, this is not a one-size-fits-all gaming mouse, though most serious gamers will appreciate it after getting used to it.<br /><br />My issue with it is not really the size. I like a larger mouse and this one is definitely large enough to fit my hand. However, the shape is a bit strange to me and it feels funny when I try to work with it. This is a personal preference but it is important enough to me to make mention of it. My son loves this mouse and says it is the best gaming mouse he has used so far, and since he is the primary user I can't complain – much.<br /><br />Other than the subtly odd shape, this is a nice mouse. It is very responsive and precise which is critical for gaming mice of any kind. It seems to be quite durable and well constructed too so it should be able to handle some serious abuse. Time will tell, of course.<br /><br />I am used to mice that have 3, 5 and occasionally 7 buttons. This one has 17! Using the included software, this is a highly programmable mouse and you can set the bank of 12 side buttons as you like, which is a great advantage when gaming to have complicated functions mapped to a single button. This  can also be a curse if you have so many things assigned that you lose track of what is mapped to each button.<br /><br />This really is a good gaming mouse that will serve well. It is well made and highly configurable. In my case I do not like the hand feel, but for my gamer son it has quickly become critical equipment.",

I was right.<br /><br />First things first – I have large hands and most mice do not fit my hands too well. This one is slightly larger than the average and as such it does fit my hands a little better. For someone with really small hands this might not be the very best fit, but for the average person or someone with larger than average hands, this one is a comfortable fit.<br /><br />The mouse comes with two sets of replaceable side panels, which connect to the mouse body via magnets and provide different button layouts. Serious gamers will like the configurability and will appreciate having more buttons available. People with more business uses for this mouse may not care, though having the buttons available does allow for setting up speed buttons.<br /><br />This is a wired mouse (as most quality gaming mice are) and the cable is encased in braided nylon. This should last a good while and resist fatigue. In my experience, the cables often wear out before the mouse itself does.<br /><br />This mouse is a smooth operator. The buttons are solid and there does not seem to be any hitches in the moving parts. The thumb wheel works well and is smooth. The sensor is a red LED underneath and it works well enough on non-reflective surfaces (rare is the mouse that works on glass or a mirror).<br /><br />The precision can be set as high as 12,000 DPI and that is useful for when you’re doing serious pixel work in image processing. I can’t really comment on how it does for gaming, though for someone with a really steady hand and a good eye this pinpoint accuracy can be an edge in a tight game.<br /><br />And…it works under Linux! I plugged it into my Linux machine and it immediately started working. It required no drivers and it just worked. I did not try everything with it, but the main functions work flawlessly. No complaints.<br /><br />This is not an inexpensive mouse, but you get what you pay for with it. It is designed to be a serious gaming mouse and it has some good features that make it suitable not just for serious gaming but also for really labor-intensive image processing and pixel work. It works under Linux too, which is just the cherry on top.",

It was fun for a bit, but the long-time SimCity fan will get bored quickly. It was only a few days before I went straight back to SimCity 4, and I've rarely played Societies since. Societies is cute, but the gameplay only lasts for a few days before you've done pretty much everything it offers. SimCity 4 offers so much more. It's a shame that EA won't be offering a SimCity 5. They pretty much shot themselves in the foot with the limiting direction they went with Societies.<br /><br />SimCity 3000 is actually my favorite of the SimCity series but there are many aspects I enjoy with SimCity 4. My favorite is how the cities interact with each other, and how I can play the connecting cities. I've never been much of an arcade type player so the U-drive it missions tended to frustrate me. But if you like those type of games you'll like the U-drive it missions. SimCity 4 would be my favorite but I still have trouble staying profitable. But that's probably due more to planning mistakes on my part rather than the game.<br /><br />Another of my favorite aspects is a little side-benefit of the game. You can use SimCity 4 to make neighborhood templates for Sims 2, which happens to be my all time favorite of all the games I have.<br /><br />There is a lot of gameplay value to SimCity 4, much more than SimCity Societies. It's at a great price, so it would make a fantastic gift for someone new to the strategy and simulation games. It would be a good present for kids as it teaches budgeting and planning while being fun.",

Only a small number of bugs can be blamed on custom content, numerous others are due to internal errors in the code of the game itself. Reach a certain number of character files in your neighborhood folder(about 800) and you'll be plagued by frustrations such as the \"final exam bug\" the \"undead elder bug\" and the \"sim graduated but won't go home to the original neighborhood bug.\" Kicky bags get stuck, only to be remedied by bulldozing the lot and Greek members develop \"amnesia\" where they lose important memories like their first kiss as a teen.<br /><br />What has EA/Maxis done to resolve these issues. First they said that they couldn't provide a separate downloadable patch, that it was \"too hard.\" A patch would be included in the next EP, Nightlife, effectively coercing consumers to pay out more money to get their game to work. Then as Sims fans expressed their outrage EA/Maxis promised to attempt to make such a patch but it still won't be available until sometime after the release of Nightlife, if ever at all. I was able to rectify my bug issues with third party bugfixes. I appreciate those modders taking the time to make the game playable but it was truly EA/Maxis' responsibility to provide timely support for their game. I am waiting at least a month before I consider purchasing Nightlife because I want to see the following-<br /><br />1. A free downloadable patch to those who've already bought University and what it will correct<br /><br />2. What the patch included in Nightlife will correct (hopefully it will be the same as the downloadable patch) and is Nightlife going to cause any new unpleasant messes from code errors<br /><br />3. EA/Maxis working to treat consumers with more respect; timely support for their product like other software companies (such as Atari and Microsoft)<br /><br />I never expected the game to be bug free, I simply expected EA/Maxis to have a better attitude about supporting the product they have sold to us.

But here's my problem. Family Fun has 60 objects, that's it. For $19.99 here at Amazon. That's not such a great deal to me. That's .33 cents per object. I think the face masks, the floor globe and the Hawaiian clothes are nice. The other stuff is plain icky. I like realistic furniture, crayon green, hot pink or purple is not my idea of realistic.<br /><br />And apparently there are bugs with this stuff pack. If you choose a Family Fun outfit in Create-A-Sim the outfit will disappear from the outfit choices. You have to have the sim buy the outfit at a clothing store until the patch comes out. It's pretty disappointing that a patch is needed for a stuff pack.<br /><br />If this pack drops $10 perhaps then I'll think about it. Otherwise with the beautiful custom content made by sim fans out there and most kindly shared for free I could easily pass on this pack.",

Same as Family Fun I'm waiting until Glamour drops to $10-12.<br /><br />Although the clothes for the adults are really nice I think it would have been good to add dressy clothes for elders and children too. The artwork is beautiful but it would have been a plus to have more from different eras. Same as the furniture. Glamour is more than just Art Deco. If they had included more styles in furniture and artwork I would have bought this immediately.<br /><br />If Maxis really wants to compete with the custom content on fan sites they're going to have to increase the amount of stuff included in a pack or lower the price.

If I'd been paying attention over the summer I would have bought Family Fun & Glamour at Circuit City at those prices but I missed the sales. $10-12 I think is a fair price for the amount of stuff in the pack.

There's all kind of free fan sites out there like ModTheSims2 with tons of downloads. There's also Pronup Sims for beautiful wedding attire and accessories. Do your research, have a good anti-virus program, stick with reputable fan sites, pay attention to what and how you download and you won't crash your game. If a new download causes a problem, remove it! Simple as that.<br /><br />Yes I do buy the stuff packs. But I don't buy them here or anywhere else for over $12. I wait until Circuit City puts the stuff packs on sale for under $10. That price is reasonable for the amount of stuff included. If Amazon was willing to do that they'd have my business.

The refridgerators do not have the options from Seasons to get leftovers and they do not have the options from Free Time to make snack platters. You'll need Lord Darcy's fix from MoreAwesomeThanYou to be able to have those options. Would be nice if EA provided a fix but they never fixed the Celebrations Stuff wedding arch so that it could be used for weddings on community lots (a feature added with Bon Voyage), the Teen Style Stuff computer is missing options included in other expansions, and the Glamour Life special TV you could get from BestBuy is missing Free Time options to watch movies. I'd be surprised if they fix this. Luckily they've all been fixed by Lord Darcy though.<br /><br />That being said, it's still a pretty nice stuff pack.

I've been playing Sims games since Sims 1 back in 2000, I'd say I'm definitely a hardcore Sims 2 player. At first I didn't think the Life Stories would be all that interesting to me, because I already have the Sims 2 base game and all expansions & stuff packs on my desktop. So I passed up the first Life Stories and Pet Stories.<br /><br />But then Castaway Stories came out, and it had new and different concepts from the prior Sims games. I've been trying to motivate myself to get on my exercise bike more so I thought perhaps it would help if I had something like Castaway Stories to play on the laptop while I exercise. As it turns out, it has been fun. The regular Sims 2 game will always be my first in favorites, but I sure have enjoyed Castaway Stories.<br /><br />There are some limits. I wish that we could add more lots, there's a way to do it with a 3rd party utility called SimPE but it's a rather intricate process. Plus, there are some troublesome bugs. My kids have been playing it lately on the laptop and have had trouble with characters disappearing from the family. Unfortunately there's little that can be done other than to start over. It's a known issue. EA has not provided any patches for the Life Stories series like they have for Sims 2.<br /><br />But overall it's a fun way for me to get my Sims fix in when I'm away from the desktop computer. The kids enjoyed it so much I am planning to buy Life Stories and Pet Stories afterall for them to play on the laptop as a holiday present.<br /><br />One thing I really wish is that EA would have incorporated some of Castaway Stories gameplay into Sims 2 Bon Voyage. The water is so beautiful in Castaway Stories, and I love how they can spear fish. I wish we had the lovely ruins and the banana & papaya trees in Bon Voyage too.",

I don't really know if that's true, but if so Apartment Life closes the series on an up note.<br /><br />Along with Seasons and Nightlife, Apartment Life is one of my favorite expansions. I really like the apartment feature, it's been long overdue. It's so much easier now to start off a sim newly graduated from University by having them live in an apartment. It's so much easier to get them suitable living quarters.<br /><br />I am so glad we finally have spiral stairs and playground equipment. They were both very much needed 4+ expansions ago.<br /><br />The social townies can be kind of annoying in a way, but the reputation feature is nice. One thing I don't like is how the new social greetings will mess up the greetings from locals at the Bon Voyage vacation neighborhoods. It's very rare now for my locals to do their normal greetings, instead they do the new social ones and my vacationing sims have a harder time of meeting the \"learn local greeting\" want without cheating on my part. But it's a minor frustration.<br /><br />Witches are pretty interesting. I like the neutral spells but some of the evil and good witch spells are kind of blah. Plus, I'm really not into the skin overlays with the evil and good witches. I don't like the green or sparkly skin so I use a mod to stop it. But overall I do like the witches and am glad we have them. They're the only paranormal creature in the Sims 2 line I've had more than a passing interest in.<br /><br />Apartment Life is a great EP and given the choice I'd gladly buy it again.

I've been a long time Sims fan, but if it has this garbage on it I'm not touching it.",

I bought it at the full retail price a year ago, had a good time with it for a couple of days but I haven't really played it since. I liked the aspects of the different types of cities but once I accomplished it I became bored. Perhaps I would have had enjoyed it longer if more of the aspects of Sim City had been left in. I'd been frustrated by some of the difficulties I'd encountered in Sim City 4 (staying profitable) but Sim City Societies was too easy, dumbed down way too much. It's a shame they didn't better incorporate aspects of both.",

So if you happen to find a sale, definitely go for it.<br /><br />Mansion & Gardens Stuff is by far the best stuff pack EA has offered. The three decorating styles; Second Empire, Moroccan, & Art Deco, are lovely. The flowers are shrubs are beautiful, a welcome addition to landscaping. I like how the windmill & solar panels will lower the sim's bills. The ceiling fans are a decorative object, but they do actually move so it's a nice realistic touch. I haven't noticed that they affect the temperature of the sims so they are probably merely decorative.<br /><br />I love the Mansard roof pieces. It makes it so much easier to have attic space that my sims can live in without being affected by the weather. I've had issues in the past of them freezing or getting heat stroke if I had bedrooms in the attic with certain types of roofs.<br /><br />Knock on wood, I haven't noticed any major glitches with Mansions & Gardens. What a relief. The grand staircases are very nice, but they sure do take up a lot of space. Your sims will autonomously slide down the banister. Usually we do not get any new interactions with stuff packs, so this was a nice surprise. Our sims can smell the flowers too.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't care for is that some of the new siding is too dark and there's only a few selections. I'm not really fond of the screaming bright yellow. I wish they would have added some of the previous siding colors we've had with the new corner trim. EA could have made this a real expansion pack with more items and options and I would have been over the moon.<br /><br />I'd consider this stuff pack a must for Sims 2 players.",

I'm a diehard Sims 2 fan and in some ways, Sims 3 seemed to take a step backward in the style of gameplay I prefer. One of my biggest frustrations is how the game is designed to almost force you to play one family only, and although I like the open neighborhood, I liked the freedom in Sims 2 of being able to easily bounce around from one family to the next at my whim. Prior expansions would keep me interested in their new interactions for a short while, but then I'd get frustrated and go back to playing Sims 2. Generations bored me so much that I didn't even bother to buy Showtime & I decided there was no way I'd buy Pets unless there was a really good sale.<br /><br />That being said, the Sims 3 Pets expansion has gone along way to make my annoyances at the new gameplay style worth it to be able to play the game. The pets are amazing, especially the horses. The horses are incredible with everything that you can do, caring for them & training. The cats & dogs are adorable and I love how the cats will sit on my sim's lap. Like with many other Sims fans, I didn't really enjoy the Sims 2 version of Pets. The strays drove me up a wall, my only recourse was to get a mod to keep them under control so that they didn't tear up community lots. The strays in Sims 3 Pets aren't bad at all.<br /><br />The additional objects are nice, and the town Appaloosa Plains is pretty. I don't like multiple-function rabbit holes though, because I'm still having issues fulfilling missions. EA doesn't seem to be too good at fixing issues before they add more. However, I think Pets is a must have for the Sims fan. I do recommend buying it on sale because I think they're grossly overpriced. Definitely buy the physical disk too. Until there's some good policy changes I think having a physical disk is the better route in case of issues and needing a return/replacement.",

I don’t regret buying it. But having said that it does have some flaws. Firstly: This Pokémon game was ALOT easier than the older Red, Blue and Yellow ones. I was able to collect all 8 badges in 10 hours of playtime, a lot of that time I wasn’t even playing and just left the game on and a lot more of it was spent in the constant cut scenes. It seems like just when I feel like I’m really getting going Sonia, or especially, Hop interfere and want to have long conversations or, for Hop, to duel me. It’s pretty annoying. Not only that but the fights are much easier. I got through every gym and got all 8 badges without losing a single battle. I didn’t even bother looking for more powerful Pokémon because the first 6 I got were fine and able to beat anyone I came across.<br /><br />Having said that, this game is great for children! It’s not too hard where they’ll get frustrated, but it’s not too easy for children either. Each gym battle (except one) is fought in a huge arena and it feels great to hear the crowd cheering you on. The music is upbeat and really got me in the mood to kick butt. Each badge earned comes with a sense of accomplishment which is great.<br /><br />All in all I do recommend this game for children or for adults who played the older games and just want some nostalgia.",

                "text": "I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I’ve spent some time with it (more than I’d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review.<br /><br />The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it’s main pro being that it’s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can’t bring my big honkin’ PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it’s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly “Switch” to the Switch and continue my game.<br /><br />There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo’s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they’re splattering paint all over each other.<br /><br />However the Switch also has its cons. Let’s start with Nintendo’s “E-Shop”. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games.<br /><br />Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony’s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly.<br /><br />All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It’s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it’s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games.<br /><br />5/5 Stars",

Or, at least, it won't turn on when connected to either my Mac or Windows computers. It's strange, because my computer will recognize when it's plugged in as any sound will try and shoot to the device, but since the actual Recon3D itself won't light up (ie, turn on), it can't connect to my Omega headphones, thus defeating the purpose.<br />I've emailed Creative to see what the issue could be.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/13/11:<br />I've kept the original review below. It turns out I was missing the card, but Creative was gracious enough to send it to me so I can experience the full sound explosion in its glory. As a company, they rock. Their products are amazing, albeit overpriced.<br /><br />Pairing the Omega headphones with their Recon3D was easy with the TacticLink (though I did have trouble at first), and the sounds is fantastic. I tested Star Wars on Blu-ray, and, sure enough, there was a huge difference from just using the Recon3D with $20 Sennheisers. Not only do the headphones make a difference, but the Recon3D does a magnificent job of imitating true THX sound. Having the Recon3D, it eliminates the cords from the Omega connecting to the TV and PS3. You only need to connect the Recon3D via USB to the PS3 and the optical cable (included) from the PS3 to the TV, and that's it. The Omega headphones sit comfortably on their rest, no other cords, pucks, plugs necessary.<br /><br />It's fantastic for console gaming, but at $300 for both, it's too pricey, considering that you can find some with slightly less sound quality for under $100. While it's multi-platform (though I've only used it with the PS3 and Macbook Pro), the price can detract some, but the sound quality makes it worth it.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Shouldn't it be the opposite? I have Creative's Tactic 3D Omega headphones, and got the Recon 3D to pair with it. It should be easier, shouldn't it? With their own products?<br />Unfortunately, that isn't the case.<br /><br />While I have praised the Recon3D, that's only because I'm using them with my $20 Sennheisers. That's where the two stars come. It gets docked enormously for the fact that Creative leaves out the TacticLink, a piece that is REQUIRED to pair their own headphones wirelessly. Unfortunately, the two items separately do not come with the TacticLink, but the bundle does--? If you buy the bundle, you save over $75, but it comes with a component that you need to pair the items. You can pair the headphones with the Recon3D, but by cable only, and I don't have the necessary cable to accomplish that.<br /><br />Therefore, their pricing is extremely skewed, and the fact that you have to pay over $75 more for both items separately when you don't even get the necessary (\"optional,\" as Creative says) component to get the full, wireless experience, make this customer a very unhappy one. Heck, I can't even get the full experience at all because the Tactic 3D Omega can't connect to the Recon3D unless I go out and buy the cable, let alone \"optional\" TacticLink, thus leaving me behind the full enjoying experience.<br /><br />It's a shame because I defended the Omega in another review, but here's where it stops.",

                "text": "As you might tell from my review, I'm not wholly pleased with these headphones. When I ordered them, I was initially excited about them. I have some Turtle Beach headphones that are slightly more expensive than these, but they do tend to become slightly uncomfortable after long periods of time.<br /><br />So I ordered these. I was on the boat about the cord, but I actually prefer cords over wireless in such devices so that I don't have to worry about scrambling for batteries or charging it when the battery's low. The length of the cord is good for my living room.<br /><br />When I plugged it into my PS3, having not yet read the instructions, I was surprised that there was no sound coming through. So I perused through the quick setup and was aghast that I, indeed, had to use the included audio jacks. I really really really really really don't like audio jacks. I understand that they might \"improve\" or have a work-around for audio, but the fact that I have to get my jacks out of my PS3 box just to plug `em into the back of the TV for audio (and since my TV has only one set of RCA ports, into which my Atari is plugged), it's really inconvenient and messy when I have to use the ol' red and white audio jacks. Haven't they done a work-around for this? I have HDMI cables, and I love `em. Surely Thrustmaster can do better. My Turtle Beach headphones, while understandably more expensive, connect into the front USB port...and that's it.<br /><br />So when I finally did what Thrustmaster bid, I tried the sound quality, and it didn't negate my already negative feelings toward the headphones. The sound sounds almost tinny, and the headphones and their longest stretch barely fit `round my head, and I don't even have a big head! I usually click two or three times on headphones to make `em fit, but on these Thrustmasters I had to pull `em all the way and even then they fit just so.<br /><br />I tried these on my iPhone, but the jack is a little big to fit with the case on my iPhone, so I took it out and tried the sound. It was rather worse since it was meant to utilize the red and white audio jacks.<br />Disgusting.<br /><br />Overall, I am disappointed. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Creative and Turtle Beach headphones, but for the price Thrustmaster could do better. Or maybe even lower the price point. My $20 Sennheisers sound better, but I'm a big fan of Sennheiser. So there.",

I played only the original Rayman on the PlayStation way back when, so this revamp of the character was a fresh and colorful experience. I wish Crash and Spyro would get the same treatment, which they inarguably deserve (Skylanders doesn't count).<br /><br />The first thing to jump out at you is the lush animation. It's top-notch, and combined with Rayman's tight controls and environment it's a rich game overall. The sequel is great and begins not too long after the first game. The introduction of more playable characters and the over-world map and paintings (a la Super Mario side-scrollers and Super Mario 64) make the game overall tighter to play and easier to keep track of your 100% goal.<br /><br />It's brutally easy in the beginning, but that's if you're not looking to get everything. There are certainly challenges for every level of skilled gamer, and the controls are just like a Mario game: a dream and an extension of your muscle memory.<br /><br />Age-wise, it's perfect for anybody. The gameplay, humor, and absolutely gorgeous graphics should no doubt appeal to all gamers, especially fans of the older Rayman games. And those who haven't played Origins, it's not necessary to play it before Legends although I strongly recommend you do.<br /><br />I have the PS3 version, obviously, and it looks great on my LCD TV. But if you want a taste of playing this game you can try out the demo at various kiosks for the Wii U (where I first encountered Legends) or download the demo readily available for your home console.",

I admit that I was very interested in this game after hearing all the hype but have never watched the show except for one episode and the film.<br />Until now.<br /><br />To prepare myself for the game, I started watching the show from the very beginning. I love it! After a few seasons I finally started to honker down and play the game.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a deep RPG game like Final Fantasy (of which I am a huge fan) or any other JRPG, but I still was pleasantly surprised by how fun this game is and its combination of exploration and fantasy and RPG. It reminded me more of the Mario RPGs: a little of the RPG element, but not as deep with just the right amount of fun.<br /><br />There's tons of customization too, and my character has gone through a few wardrobes. Because I'm only through a few seasons in the show, there are some things that have gone over my head, but a few still that I understood and have actually laughed out loud about. There's much more depth and resolution in the game than what I'm watching now, and I heard it's pretty exact to how the show appears nowadays.<br /><br />The game has extreme amounts of quality and polish considering, from what I've heard, its development background. There's much love in the game from Parker & Stone as there is in the show.

                "text": "For years I have been using the MX 518. It's a fantastic mouse, but there have been many upgrades and additions to mouse technology since then. I've been drooling over other mice, namely from Razer, Zowie, and Logitech; Logitech has the best general mice, though they may not have as many fancy features as others. Still, if you want a sturdy mouse that will last you years, Logitech is the way to go.<br /><br />The G502 combines the best of all mouse worlds for me. It's got a braided cord, combines my favorite colors in their scheme, has a two-way scroll wheel WITH BUTTON, different DPI buttons, forward and backward buttons, and an additional side button. It also has two buttons behind the scroll wheel, but one is dedicated to the wheel mode setting. There's also a longer groove on the side for the thumb to rest, and it's more comfortable than the one on my MX 518. The wheel tilts to allow side scrolling, but it never works for me the way I want it no matter how I change the settings.<br /><br />I had an Anywhere MX mouse and I HATED the wheel. I much preferred the MX 518 scrolling, and still kind of do. The Proteus uses the same wheel type as the Anywhere, but the clicking isn't as forceful; it's still harder than the MX 518, but I've actually gotten quite used to it now.<br /><br />The left mouse button is shorter and higher than the right one, and that's perfect for me as I have a semi-claw grip. The \"G\" icon does indeed have a bright light, but it's never bothered me. Either way, you can change the setting to how long it stays on while idle or to shut off permanently.<br />I'll get to the weights in a bit.<br /><br />But the best feature? For me at least it's the reprogrammable buttons.<br />I've reprogramed the wheel button and the one behind, as well as the additional button in front of the forward button. The forward and backward buttons I've kept the same, and I'm glad to report that they're much better stationed than the one on my MX 518. The MX forward button caused me to slide my hand to reach it, whereas I can easily reach both on the Proteus without removing my hand from the mouse.<br />The lip is very comfortable for my thumb, and provides more of a rest than my previous \"gaming\" mouse.<br /><br />Now for the weights.<br />They come with the mouse in this neat little case. The bottom of the mouse opens extremely easily, but it's sturdy enough so that it won't come undone on its own. There's no tactile or audible click or anything, but you'll tell when the bottom is securely back on. I've used only one weight so far and I'm pretty satisfied with that. I tested it over a week with different weights before deciding on my own preference.<br /><br />Most of the mouse is made of plastic as you'd expect, while the sides have this nice rubber texture for better grip. It's not the sort of rubber that will show dead skin easily, so no worries there. This is my first mouse with a braided cable, and I'm quite pleased with its lightweight maneuverability thus far.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased. It's everything I wanted in a mouse, and a worthy upgrade to my MX 518. I keep the latter at work now.<br /><br />I'm not a gaming expert; I just wanted a comfortable mouse that'll be perfect for all my normal tasks, and will prove competent for my Steam gaming.<br />There are some pretty good wireless mouses out there, but I always tend to stick with corded when possible to decrease computer error. Same applies for my video games The Proteus couldn't have come at a better time, as I've only recently started to consider upgrading my mouse. I'm glad I waited, despite how new this is.

                "text": "Let me start off by saying I am mostly a typist and have not gamed seriously in about a year. I type all day, every day, so the keyboard is an essential part of my quotidian experience. And I am no stranger to mechanical keyboards; I own or have owned almost every type of switch out there: Cherry MX (linear, tactile, clicky), Gateron MX (linear, tactile, clicky), Kailh MX (linear), Topre (55g), buckling spring (Model M), Hi-Tek NMB (clicky), and, of course, good ol' rubber-domes.<br /><br />That said, I missed the full-size layout. Before this keyboard, I had only one in the standard 104-size, but it was hardly used. It was an old keyboard from the early 90s and had a huge bezel. While I'm a huge fan of wider bezels, on a keyboard that's full-size it can be straining to keep your hand on the mouse, especially, if you have a somewhat smaller desk.<br />With this board, however, that bezel is mostly removed. There's not even an inch on any of the sides away from the keys; this is about as compact as you're going to get in a mass-produced keyboard. What makes that better is that your mouse is going to be closer to you. I still prefer TKL keyboards with a separate number pad either to the left of my keyboard or the right of my mouse, but you prefer 104-key keyboards then this one will do just fine without taking up much space.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I'm a typist. I haven't played a game in a couple of months, so this review will be based off the experience of a typist, which I'm assuming almost every gamer does anyway, whether for school, work, or general recreation.<br />The key caps have a texture on them that gripped my fingers as I typed. I can see that these would be good for gaming, but as for general, everyday typing I was not a fan. Thankfully, one of the great things about mechanical keyboards is that you can customize them; so off came the caps. The stabilized caps (space bar, Enter, Shifts, Back Space, and the long number pad keys) were a bit more difficult to take off. The board uses costar stabilizers (or a variant), which means that there is a wire under each cap and loops that insert into the keys to connect to the wire, thereby &#34;stabilizing&#34; them. When pulling off the key caps from these switches, take care not to take them off all the way or else you will rip off the whole wire and, sometimes, the stabilizer clip from the top plate. Not to worry too much, though, as you can pop these back in, similar to older Alps stabilizers.<br /><br />So, once I got these caps removed and placed my own I was ready to type. For a while I hated the kickstands on keyboards; they were always too high for my taste. That said, I cannot use completely flat keyboards anymore after delving into mechanical keyboards, and, thankfully, the legs on this board on that high. So kicked them I did.<br /><br />As for gaming, I do not agree that MX Blue switches, which are tactile and clicky, are ideal. I think Red and Black switches are more desirable, with Red if you need faster presses. Those switches are linear with no bump whatsoever; you simply press them and they slide down. With Blue, you have some resistance about halfway. For typing, they're absolutely fine. The feel is great, but the noise is harsh after a while.<br /><br />The LEDs glow brightly, which I actually like. Usually I'm not a fan of colored LEDs, but something about red makes the glow pleasant in dimmed rooms.<br /><br />I do like that the cable is detachable as well. Makes it that much easier for me to swap out the multiple keyboards I use at a given notice.<br /><br />As for the case, I mentioned it's sleek, but it does give some flex when putting on other caps. When I placed a set I have which is relatively easy to place or remove, I found that the case bent down almost every time.<br /><br />With all that said, I believe you can find better &#34;gaming&#34; boards for your money, with a switch that is designed for gaming. While I believe there's definitely a market for blue clicky switches, and some gaming boards come with other clicky alternatives, a keyboard designed for gaming would be best suited with linear switches; or, in the case of Logitech, even an in-house made switch.",

                "text": "Got this one for work. Eventually I'd like to get a Master, but that will have to be put on the back-burner for now. So far, I've used a basic Logitech mouse, an MX 518, and the Proteus Core in the last ten years. They all were my favorites mouses (yes, you heard me right: &#34;mouses&#34;), and I've been itching to replace the perfectly fine MX 518 I have at work, so I nabbed this one.<br /><br />I think what they're trying to here is merge their lower-end mouses with their higher-end gaming mouses, so that they're able to offer their features to those on a lower budget. So far, I think this is fantastic, but that doesn't mean there aren't issues. It looks, when the lights are off, and feels like a $15 Logitech mouse. Which isn't a bad thing.<br />Every Logitech mouse I've used is far better than most of the alternatives. They make great mouse, and I will continue to source my non-trackball input devices from them in the future. On my desk, it looks like the old, beige Logitech one I had when I first started at this job, which most likely came with one of their computers years ago. The click isn't really sensitive as there's not much down stroke, and it's VERY low-profile. I use a fingertip grip and this thing can get a bit uncomfortable for me at times.<br /><br />As for settings, you can use a few of the more basic settings you can from other gaming mouses. You can't switch between as many settings as more-dedicated gaming mouses, but they're still there. For a work computer, this mouse improves my navigation by a ton, but, like a said, the size does make it a bit uncomfortable for long periods of time.<br /><br />The scroll wheel has no infinite scroll feature, which is the biggest physical downfall I found in terms of physical features. The side buttons are placed better than the MX 518 as I can reach them more easily, and the middle button behind the wheel acts as the tracking speed switcher. The scroll wheel can act as another button upon pressing, if you like, but I have that switched to off as I don't find it necessary for my use.<br /><br />The light does have RGB, but I keep it on a cool blue all the time. You can have it set to either on or off, but I prefer on at a very low setting. I wish it would turn off completely after being idle after a while, but if you leave it on the &#34;on&#34; setting it remains on until the power source (i.e., the computer) is completely off.<br /><br />If you think of it as a budget office mouse with neat little gaming features, then this one will serve handsomely. At $40 retail, however, I think it's priced a little high. Knock it down $10 and this will be the go-to mouse for all looking for a great mouse under $50.",

I have it plugged into my computer as it was the only way to turn on the DAC, then have a line-out cable from the Note8 headphone jack to the DAC, and, finally, the USB cables from the DAC to the headphones. Whew! But they work! As I use these at work, I can't have any music on the work machine; so I have to use my phone, which has most, if not all, my FLAC files. I guess one good thing about having to plug it into the PC is that I can quickly watch a YouTube here or there as the sound from the computer connects to the DAC-headphones.<br /><br />This is the first time I use headphones with no physical adjustment on the actual main band. Rather, there is an elastic band that stretches as you put the headphones over your head and down to cover your ears. Since this is an over-ear headphone, you'll know when it's a good fit when the pads go completely around your ears.<br />Thankfully, you don't really need to download software to control the phones. Even though I use this at work, I tested out all the features by using the GameDAC device alone. I turned off all the lights in the end but did some testing with them and they were nice. I like that they come with RGB lights, which is cool depending on what you're in the mood for.<br /><br />The mic is telescopic, but I haven't used that past the day it was opened. I was able to hear everything in my environment just fine, though. The caps on the headphones are magnetic, so they're removable, and my guess is for swapping them with ones with different designs.<br /><br />Sometimes I feel like the sound isn't at its peak for the price when listening to music. I switch to HDR and regular PC input and I honestly cannot tell much of a difference, even when fiddling with my phone's settings. I know you oughtn't use a phone for music referencing, but my Note8 with PowerAmp and FLAC should power these headphones moderately well, and I feel underwhelmed when using these cans with the GameDAC for listening to music.<br /><br />The construction is fantastic, though. These are some of the most comfortable I've worn in this price range, and the metal hinges feel extremely sturdy. I can wear these all day at work and not get fatigued.<br /><br />The volume wheel on the left is very sensitive, and I'm constantly fiddling with it. Between the volume from my phone, the DAC, and the headphones, there are a lot of volumes to be handled. I wish with my setup there was a way to turn off the volume from the headphones and rely just on the DAC. Also, I'm accidentally pressing the volume on/off button for the mic, but it's easier to tell when it's off as the sides of the button are red and show so when the volume button is depressed.<br /><br />I think for the price point it's fine considering you get a fully fledged gaming set with GameDAC. As headphones for audiophiles, I don't think it's that great for the price. I get better sound quality with my Audio Technica, which are $100 cheaper and don't even come with a DAC.",

                "text": "I tend to prefer first-party controllers over third-party ones. I also consider myself to prefer original hardware over emulators when it comes to older consoles. That said, I have both of Analogue's Nintendo products and the former came with an 8BitDo controller. \"Neat,\" I thought, \"but I will never use it.\" I was wrong.<br /><br />After an update, I found very minimal lag with the N30 controller and the Retro Receiver. Even on my HDTV. For games that required zero-lag precision, I opted for my first-party, wired controllers, but for RPGs and such I default to 8BitDo's controller. It's not the most comfortable because of the square shape of the original NES controller (dogbone controller all the way), but the fact that I can play a near-authentic NES on my HDTV, while sitting comfortably on my couch, is a huge bonus.<br /><br />With the Analogue Super Nt I decided to go with 8BitDo's SNES-styled controller in matching colors. I liked it very much and, again, experienced little lag.<br />When 8BitDo announced this past summer all the controllers they were releasing, I drooled over all the colors and made it a habit of checking Amazon's site for pre-orders. Seeing as I no longer have a functioning NA SNES controller, I decided to go with the good ol' lavender buttons this time around; I miss the concave and convex buttons.<br /><br />8BitDo has been doing a great job of making products in such large masses with quality packaging and materials. The box is a nice matte, sleeved container with just the controller and USB-mini cable within--no more, no less. The controller has a bit of a shine on the face, though, that you can't really tell from the pictures. I like it; it's a bit darker in person and has a sort of glittery effect depending on the angle you hold it.<br /><br />The buttons are great. So far I used it with my Note8 and my SNES's Retro Receiver. I experience very slight lag with the Note8, but no noticeable ones with the RR. One thing to note is that there may be firmware updates for these controllers. I know the N30 needed one to minimize lag, but I haven't checked whether there were any updates for this one.<br /><br />I recall some customers saying they had issues with the d-pad on previous versions of this controller. I haven't had any issues. The sequence of buttons to pair is a bit different on this one than my SN30 Famicom-colored one; I think they made it a bit more complicated, but at least you get a set of instructions in case you forget.<br /><br />The ABXY buttons are a bit clicky on these controllers, which doesn't bother me in the slightest. I actually prefer that over the aged, mushy ones on my older first- and third-party SNES controllers. I haven't touched a new SNES controller since my cousin got an SNES for his birthday when they were new, but I have a new, original NES controller; the buttons are slightly clicky as well. If the SNES controllers were the same, then age and age only made the buttons \"mushy\"; the buttons on the 8BitDo aren't that much clickier than my new NES controller.<br /><br />Otherwise, everything works as expected, and it's great to hold a quality SNES controller replica while sitting comfortably on my couch, devoid of cable length.",

                "text": "(Update at bottom.)<br /><br />I need to preface this by saying I'm a big fan of 8BitDo. I've pre-ordered almost all of their controllers this year, and am looking out for the Zero 2 and SN30 Pro+. I think they're fast becoming one of the best third-party controller makers out there, second only to Hori.<br />I was a skeptic at first, but ever since one came with my Analogue Nt mini I was a quick fan.<br /><br />I opted for the N64 variant for the N30 pro 2. While the GameCube colors definitely pop more, I prefer a more muted iteration. Plus, there's not as enough N64 love compared to GCN!<br /><br />I also have to say that this is my first 8BitDo controller with analog sticks. As I did not own the previous N30 Pro, I wasn't aware of how small this controller is compared to others. Mind you, it's not a micro controller, but it's definitely about 1/3 or so smaller than controllers like the Wii Classic Controller (Pro). If you came into this knowing this already, then great; but if you're like me and were expecting a standard-size controller, then it's something you'd want to consider. As such, everything is shrunken, from the buttons to the sticks. It's better as a travel controller, but maybe not so for home use.<br />That's one star docked for me, but I realize that's more of a personal preference.<br /><br />I do like that it uses USB-C to charge, and it charged right away. There are two LEDs along the side to indicate battery and pairing status. They're bright, but not glaringly so. I was pleased when I made this discovery when I first plugged it in.<br /><br />Since this is geared toward Switch users, there are Switch buttons at the bottom; I do not own a Switch at the moment. I plan on using this with my Android and PC for now, and then see how it tests with a Switch when I get one.<br />But I do want to point out that, when I plugged in the controller to charge, I accidentally pressed the Switch buttons that are located at the button. They're clicky, but very easy to press, whether intentionally or accidentally.<br /><br />On my Android and PC, I noticed some small lag between inputs. It wasn't bad, but definitely not zero-lag. I'm sure it's just the programs I used that inserted the lag. The buttons are nicely clicky, and 8BitDo has made the best third-party d-pad to date, something which is not very easy to accomplish.<br />While minuscule, the buttons do not feel noticeably small. They're easy to locate and press with tactility, and the analog sticks even have buttons themselves!<br /><br />The second star that I'd like to dock, however, comes from the shoulder buttons. I get what 8BitDo was trying to do here, but the L1 and R1 triggers are a bit difficult for me to press. They're located on the outer part of the top, while L2 and R2 are toward the center. It's like the new 3DS, but the way my index fingers rest on the top here makes it so that I press L2 and R2 instead of L1 and R1, unless I move them to uncomfortable positions. Some people might be able to press the outer shoulder buttons more easily--perhaps with the inside of a knuckle--but my fingers won't let me do so comfortably. With computers, you can easily fix this by swapping them, but you would have to with every program. With consoles, this may not be as easy if they're hard-programmed inputs. I hope 8BitDo offers a firmware version where you can swap these.<br /><br />I am otherwise pleased and do not regret my purchase. You get a nice, universal controller with analog sticks (that have buttons), vibration, and wonderful color schemes. This is more of a travel controller and is at least much better than other travel controllers. I'm not sure whether I want to order a Zero 2 as now I fear that may be too small!<br /><br />(PS, sorry for the rotated picture. It showed up fine on my PC.)<br /><br />***UPDATE 11/30/18***<br /><br />Okay, so after using this a few more days after writnig this review I have to say it's grown on me. I'm bumping it up from 3 to 4 stars because, as a controller for Android or computer systems, it works marvelously. The little sticks are actually very comfortable to use despite being minuscule, and the d-pad still is wonderful, but the shoulder problems still remain an issue for me. The inner buttons, while easier to press, are a bit *too* clicky for me (and this coming from someone who loves clickiness).",

As a former figure collector, I understand how much paint detail can go into a figure, which would drive up the cost. At around $15 per amiibo, they have way more paint detail then they have any right to. And they have nice heft, too. This one in particular is *solid*!",

                "text": "Out of all the third-party controllers out there thus far, this one is my favorite, despite it not having vibration. I wound up getting both the gray and gold (GameStop exclusive) colors. I have this one, the PDP, and the official Nintendo one (I also plan on getting the Hori one), and I've been using this one the most. In many respects, this definitely is the WaveBird 2.0.<br /><br />The build is pretty good, though the shell is made of pretty thin plastic compared to an original GCN controller. The PDP controller feels a lot better than this one. Also, with the silver and gold variants, the color is actually painted on; when I removed the battery cover I could see the clear shell underneath the paint.<br /><br />The buttons all feel really good. The analog triggers have less travel, which is fine for me. The two Z buttons have a more tactile and audible click, which also is welcome. They have slightly more travel than the original controller, which may also help with tactile feedback. The shape overall seems pretty much the same, and the rest of the buttons feel the same as well.<br /><br />The gates around the sticks, however, are higher, which to me is a lot better than the original, especially when it comes to games like Smash. What this means is that there's less travel for the sticks, making moves tighter and faster. I'm not sure how this bodes with platformers as I've yet to try that (should get Odyssey shortly), but for games like Smash it works great.<br /><br />The convenience factor alone makes the price tag worth it. Yes, it's more expensive than the original, first-party controller, but you get more colors, Switch-specific buttons, and wireless connectivity. There is no vibration/rumble, sadly, but if you've grown accustomed to using the WaveBird then you'll find no frills here. Truly, it's the WaveBird 2.0, even down to the stripped rumble!",

Once it's connected it's fine, but it may take a few minutes for it to pair.<br /><br />The buttons are nice and responsive, and the joysticks are tight and snappy.

                "text": "I don't have an NES Classic, but after seeing this style controller for the NES Classic I was hoping 8BitDo would make a Bluetooth version, and here we are!<br /><br />I was introduced to 8BitDo when I received my Analogue Nt mini. I heard of them before but saw them as just another third-party maker that wouldn't make it as well as Hori. Two years later and almost ten controllers later, 8BitDo is already in my top three third-party makers list.<br />I became accustomed to the diamond layout of their previous N30; sure, it wasn't traditional, but it's more modern and I adapted to it well enough. But for games that require more precision, I fell back to my original NES controllers. This new N30 v2 is a far better iteration than the v1.<br /><br />There were two issues I found with it, however. The first being the update process. Always, always, ALWAYS update your 8BitDo devices when you receive them. Even if they just came out, the controllers and adapters almost always have a firmware update that you'll need to clear out some issues. So that's what I did here, but for some reason the update tool was a bit wonky compared to my previous experiences. 8BitDo has a couple of applications for updating the firmware, and it's either hit or miss on which will work. The first time I tried updating this it seemed to fry my controller. It wouldn't update and the controller wouldn't turn on for about half an hour. No LED lights of any kind, no matter how many cables I plugged in or what button combos I used. After leaving the controller alone for about twenty minutes, I went back to it and it magically started working again, and the firmware tool updated it fine. For the record, the stock firmware was some beta version, whereas the latest firmware (as of this writing) was 6.10.<br /><br />The other issue I'll get into in just a sec.<br /><br />I first paired this with my Switch since it's touted as a Switch controller for the Nintendo Online games. I don't have Nintendo Online as of right now, but plan to in the near future. For Puyo Puyo Tetris, it worked well. I thought the top buttons would be mapped as X and Y, but not so; they truly are turbo buttons even when paired with modern Bluetooth devices. The Home button worked fine, but I sort of wished it was a Capture button instead since I use that more. I know this controller is a carbon copy of their NES Classic version, so they just reused the front faceplate, but still.<br /><br />After that, I tested it with my NES Retro Receiver and Nt mini, and have been using it with that ever since. It works beautifully. The Receiver (and the Switch) recognize the controller immediately, and I can say that I experienced very minimal lag, if at all. I put away my diamond-layout N30 v1--which was my go-to NES controller--and supplanted it with this, which now is my go-to wireless NES controller. For more precise games like Punch-Out!! I still prefer wired controllers just for placebo's sake, but honestly I can't tell that much difference in lag between these two.<br />My other issue is that I wish the action buttons were just a smidge higher. The top turbo buttons are closer to the center than the main A and B buttons, but it's nothing to make my muscle memory miss a button. For games where I do need turbo, it's more comfortable.<br /><br />The buttons are clickier than overused NES controllers, but I have an original NES controller that is in near-new condition, and the clickiness isn't that far from home. The d-pad is great; however, I noticed mine has a slight angle that it wants to stay in. It's not anything that causes missed directions, but I thought I should point that out anyway.<br /><br />I know some people in the past claim they have mispresses for the d-pad, but I've never had that issue, and I still don't. Nevertheless, I went back and put some of those circle reinforcement stickers on the contacts of the PCB, and I might do that here as well, if just for peace of mind.<br /><br />Now here's hoping they make an FC30 v2 in this button scheme!",

I remember seeing a friend's Duke back when the Xbox was brand new, but never was startled at the size. These days the more comfortable controllers are larger, and that's reasonable because, as an adult, I can't do smaller controllers or handhelds without larger gripping surfaces.<br /><br />But man. This thing is massive.<br /><br />I got the transparent green color as I love transparent video game peripherals, and green screamed Xbox to me. I'm usually not a fan of green, but I figured it was appropriate for Xbox.<br />I don't own an Xbox One, but got this to use on my PC mostly for Steam games and some others. It works great for them.

I expect that some modders will do so.<br /><br />Most of the gripping area is unnecessary; you wind up just using the upper half for the buttons. The analog triggers and the vibration feel a little cheap on mine. The triggers squeak and the rumble causes the entire shell to rattle. Otherwise, everything else feels great. The buttons have nice tactility to them, and the digital shoulders feel great. The sticks are great and feel like first-party construction.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the cable is detachable; you can't use this controller without it, and it probably would've been better for longevity's sake to make the cable attached with a reinforced port.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey for what it is; I assume most of the cost goes toward the limited screen.

I obtain grips for all my handhelds, and since I play a good deal amount of handheld mode for my Switch, I decided to get this one as well. I did a lot of research and whittled it down to four; in descending order, they are: Satisfye, Skull & Co, Cyber Gadget, and RDS GoPlay.<br />My main requirement was that the grip would come with in a dedicated case, which left me with these options. (Though I also considered the Cyber Gadget one as they haven't failed me in the past, but unfortunately it neither comes with a case nor is in stock online.)<br /><br />After much excitement and watching and reading reviews, I placed my order. Before getting the grip, I had very little trouble with holding the Switch in handheld mode; it's the first handheld that has never given me hand cramps; perhaps it's due to the wider form. Still, there are times when my thumbs have awkward reach for certain buttons.<br />After I placed my order, my order arrived within a week from China. Nice!<br /><br />Now, the angled grips seemed like an intuitive choise. It's the first handheld grip I've seen that has asymmetrical grips so that you can reach both thumbsticks without issue. I was curious to try it and see how it would improve my handheld experience. At the moment, my favorite grips are (in no particular order): Hori's Monster Hunting Gear for the new 3DS XL, a speaker/grip combo I imported from a European company called BiGBANG! for the DS Lite (though I think it might be a rebrand from an American version), and Joytech's rechargeable battery grip for the Game Boy Advance (original, not SP version). Those grips bring the handheld experience closest to holding controllers. I imagine it's also due to the smaller sizes of the handhelds.<br /><br />So when the package arrived the first thing I did was tear open the box and grab the handle. It felt fine on its own, so, after my Switch was done charging, I immediately placed it in the grip. And right then is when I had mixed feelings about it. I knew the angle would take some adjusting to, so I played for two solid hours the first night.<br /><br />Here's what I experienced, and still experience a month later:<br />I prefer the right side overall, but I would find a perfect grip if both sides had symmetrical grips that were \"fuller\" like the right but angled like the left. I modified my Switch with a d-pad on the left Joy-Con and find that the Satisfye grip makes accessing the d-pad somewhat uncomfortable.<br />Also, because the grip has a lopsided layout, my right arm wants to pull at it to make it even, which causes the screen to go crooked. I think if they made it so that the bar across the back of the Switch would be lopsided as well, the screen would be even.<br /><br />Additionally, I found that, to compensate for the odd angle, my right arm tends to protrude out awkwardly sometimes. If you take notice on some of Satisfye's own marketing photos, you'll see some of these people hold their right arm out awkardly, too.<br /><br />I've gotten accustomed to using it for about a month, but it's still awkward; my right hand now prefers of the right side, whereas the left handle is very lacking. It feels insubstantial compared to the substance the right side brings. I do like that the case can fit the grip, some games, and a few accessories, though. Be aware that the case indeed is massive. It is perfectly square so the width is very demanding, especially in backpacks. The thumb sticks are okay, but I prefer the Skull & Co. and Cyber Gadget ones.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent grip and I don't regret paying the money for it. It's very sturdy and feels like it will last decades without wearing down. Unfortunately, I'm a \"one and done\" kind of person, and I was hoping I would purchase this as my one and only Switch grip. I'll more than likely be ordering a few others to see which I like best.",

It's hollow, though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky, more so than the ones on the Pro Controller, and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However, because of the slightly wider (larger?) size, the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer, which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games, but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.<br /><br />The back buttons are a nice addition, though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often, but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses, but are within reach if necessary.<br /><br />The texture is a nice matte feel, so no sweaty palms.<br /><br />Overall, a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.",

                "text": "(For some reason my review keeps reverting to the PS4 version, even though I delete and resubmit under the Switch version. This review is based on playing the version for the Switch.)<br /><br />CTR was the first game I ever 100%'d. Even for years after, I tried my darnedest to unlock Nitros Oxide, refusing to believe all the confirmations out there that he just wasn't unlockable. My sisters, dad, and cousins would play this game non-stop for months. I still have my original copy, and purchased it on PSN for my PS3 and PSP. This is the only game I have to get on all possible systems (besides Plants vs. Zombies). So I was pretty freakin' ecstatic when they announced a remake.<br /><br />First, the loading times. They are awful. I was talking to a co-worker about the game this morning and he said he was reading reviews that the game was great but that they mentioned the long loading times. I didn't believe it, but I was wrong. They occur when you load up races, and at the beginning of the story mode. They sort of kill the enthusiasm. I had heard that they're not that bad on other systems, but on the Switch it takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute before every track. Definitely needs to get fixed. I can see myself bringing this to friends' houses only for the loading to create a buzzkill.<br /><br />Once you get past them, though, you can actually play. And here's my other biggest problem: the hopping. I can't play CTR without the boosts. I've played MK8D and TSR and I'm always drifting and boosting, and it's all thanks to CTR when I played starting 20 years ago. I don't know what it is, but the jumping doesn't feel the same this time. Either the jumps are too high or they're too long, but they're definitely floaty. I'm actually able to change the direction mid-air, which I don't recall doing. I played the original to confirm, and the jumps definitely are slightly longer/higher here than in the original. In the original, the characters feel a wee bit heavier, which is far better for power sliding.<br />Subsequently, I'm not able to time and complete my boosts as I was before. I really hope I'm wrong and it's just me being a bit rusty, but if it's not the same then I'm going to have to change the way I play this game.<br /><br />Now, as for the positives, I love the extra content they added without really detracting from the overall experience. The visuals are beautiful, and they've added things here and there to the tracks without really changing them (e.g., Coco's track has a statue of Coco, Crash Cove has a sculpt of Crash, etc.). I played CNK back when it released, but don't really remember it. I really like that they added the CNK tracks and the other character; there were a couple of CNK tracks I remember but the characters I don't recall at all. Still, a nice touch.<br /><br />The customization really worried me when they announced it, as I had thought it would change the driving mechanics, but not so. In kart racers like MK, there are way too many customizations and I can never find one that feels right (and by right I mean one that drives like CTR). Here, the customizations are purely cosmetic, which I more than welcome. Each driver is the same from the previous iteration, and the little changes to the character and kart are just for show.<br />Thank goodness.<br /><br />Here's hoping Activision/Beenox updates the loading times for the Switch and, if necessary, the jumps. Right now, the jumps need to be either lower or shorter.",

                "title": "Has Hori finally been dethroned?",
                "text": "Well, maybe not yet.<br /><br />To me, Hori has been the king of third-party controllers. They have the advantage of time and presence. From all the way back to the SNES era, Hori has been making controllers for all (or at least nearly all) major systems. Their stuff may not always be home-runs (heck, some of their stuff don't even make it to first base), but their stuff is usually the next-best option after first-party controllers. Sometimes, they even make controllers better than the first-party option (I nod to you, Hori Pad Mini for the N64), and they've made the best third-party controller of all time (I'll get you soon, Digital Controller for the GameCube).<br />Lately, many third-party manufacturers have been narrowing the gap between Hori and the rest. We have PowerA to thank for their excellent GameCube-style Switch controllers, and Retro-bit has been stepping up their game lately with the phenomenal Sega and Hori Pad Mini controllers. And now we have strong newcomers like Retro Fighters and, of course, 8BitDo.<br /><br />I've mentioned in previous reviews that I've dismissed 8BitDo as yet another sub-par third-party manufacturer. It wasn't until my Analogue Nt mini arrived with one that I tried one and swallowed my words. As an owner now of eight different 8BitDo controllers, I can say I'm convinced, and I now dare say that this may be their best one yet; it's probably the strongest contender to the Pro Controller we have.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the G Edition the day it was possible, and it arrived last night. I've played a few games, mostly CTR:NF. Here are my initial impressions.<br /><br />Out of the box, I immediately felt this was the Switch's version of the DualShock 4. Of course, that's not to say this controller is just for the Switch, as it works with many other systems, but most people are probably getting it for the Switch--including yours truly. The main thing I wanted to know is how the d-pad work, especially on the G Edition as it mimics the d-pad found in the DMG with the little grips. This is by far the best d-pad 8BitDo has produced. The plastic is sturdy, but it's also the same softer material you'd find on Nintendo's first-party d-pads; it also has rounded-off corners so that they're not sharp. Many companies' cross-style d-pads seem to be made of a harder plastic or have too-sharp edges, which can make for a sore extended play session. This d-pad is easier on the thumb, and the little grips indeed have some grittier surface to them that makes it easier to keep the thumb on. There's still that odd, scratchy plastic sound that seems to be on all 8BitDo controllers when pressing the d-pad, though it doesn't affect feel or gameplay. Anyone who owns an 8BitDo controller will probably know what I'm talking about; when I press my d-pad down, I hear this unpleasant, harsh \"thock.\" Otherwise, this is probably the best non-Nintendo d-pad we currently have for the Switch. In this area, 8BitDo has passed.<br /><br />My next favorite thing about the controller is the L/R and ABXY buttons. They have the same, soft tactile feedback as the L/R buttons on the Pro Controller. I love it. I prefer these ABXY buttons over the Pro Controller. My favorite ABXY buttons were probably those on the Wii Classic Controller/Pro, but now I think these may be my favorite. They have optimal travel distance (not too much, not too little), and provide the same, soft feel when pressed as the shoulder buttons. Divine.<br />However, I feel that the L2/R2 buttons have too much travel. You can use the separate Ultimate Software to customize the input register, but all it does it just stop the input beyond a certain point. I prefer the L2/R2 buttons on the Pro Controller and DualShock 4. There's too much travel here for my tastes.<br /><br />I haven't really fiddled with the sticks much, but they seem nearly identical to the ones on the DualShock 4, albeit slightly narrower in girth. The travel for the actual gates are fine, but the sticks are just a bit on the smaller side.<br /><br />The handles are great. I felt no discomfort while playing for two hours straight of CTR:NF. I do find the controller to be a bit wide for me, and the L/R buttons are a bit too forward and far from my index fingers than I'd like, but I realize I may have smaller hands than average. The entire housing of the controller is made from a nice, robust plastic that seems like it'll last for decades.<br /><br />I've read reviews prior to receiving mine mentioning the weak vibration, and I do have to agree. Even after adjusting the vibration with the Ultimate Software (which you have to download separately), it left much to be desired. There's no HD vibration, but even the standard vibration here is a bit on the weak side.<br /><br />As for lag, I detected none. I updated to the current firmware as of this writing (v3.01) and the input is snappy. When playing Golf Story, my presses would stop the swing meter precisely when I intended, and in CTR:NF my power slides were easier to control than with other controllers.<br /><br />Finally, to give the Ultimate Software its own paragraph, I fiddled with it a bit to see what it's like. As of this writing (Aug. 9, 2019), it's available only for Windows machines. I had to borrow a Windows machine momentarily. As soon as I plugged in the controller, the software detected it and even upgraded my controller to the latest firmware--neat. It's all GUI, so it's very user-friendly. Nevertheless, the only modifications I did were shorten the input register of the L2/R2 buttons so that it would stop the input halfway, and raise the vibration. I don't think I really raised it as it was already at the maximum, but I lowered and raised it anyway just to make sure the weak vibration was really physical and not adjustable beyond its strength. Alas, it didn't really help much.<br />There's a tab in the software to add macros, but right now I couldn't really think of any to add.<br /><br />So, in case it wasn't evident, I'm a fan. I'm a huge, huge fan. This controller will be in my top three controllers to use for the Switch, and probably will be my exclusive for certain games (like CTR:NF). This is 8BitDo's answer to the DualShock 4, and in some certain areas it exceeds its inspiration (like the d-pad and ABXY buttons).",

                "text": "I love me my controllers and grips. I try to get grips for every handheld. And while the Switch isn't a handheld, I have purchased a couple of grips for use in handheld mode. When I first saw the Hori Split Pad Pro announced, I knew I had to order one. Hori makes great products (mostly), and their grips for handhelds are awesome. And now we have the first officially licensed alternative to Joy-Cons. When pre-orders went up, I was a bit taken aback by the price. I knew what the Split Pad Pro had and lacked from the press releases, but I didn't know it still would cost almost as much as a set of Joy-Cons.<br />I still think they're overpriced, but in the end it didn't prevent me from ordering a set.<br /><br />One thing that concerned me was that the handle grips may not be long enough. I know Hori wants to make this compatible with the official dock, so they kept the grips short. However, I wish they would've instead made them extend back more.<br /><br />Hori has released all kinds of buttons and d-pads in the past. Before getting this, I thought the d-pad may have been similar to the soft, low-set d-pad they have on their PS4 Mini controller. So when I opened up the box the first thing I handled was the d-pad. At first, it seemed nice, comparable to other d-pads. It's stiffer than I expected, though I hope it'll get easier to press with time. However, after using it for a solid two weeks, I don't think it will be one of my favorite d-pads. I'll get to that more later.<br /><br />Comfort-wise, it's nice. It's not great, but it's nice. Coming from the Satisfye, I expected these not to be far from that comfort, but after a while I find the Satisfye grip to be more comfortable. I know Hori wanted to keep the grip handles short to accommodate the dock, but I wish they instead extended it out and back instead. I'm finding that an eggplant back is better for gripping. However, the DualShock 4 is probably one of the most comfortable controllers I've used, and the little grips on here provide little comfort by comparison.<br /><br />The sticks have excellent range. They're pretty much on par with the Pro Controller, and I love using them. They even seem to be the right diameter of the Pro Controller, as I'm able to use thumb stick covers that originally are for the Pro Controller.<br /><br />The major problem I have with the grips, and the reason I don't use them that often, is the layout of the handles. Rather than providing large grips to allow the Switch to be docked with the grips on, Hori opted to truncate the handles so they can stay on whether in handheld or docked mode. However, they either should've nevertheless made them longer or thicker. There is no point to make these dockable since they have no internal battery; the point of leaving the official Joy-Cons on when docked is to charge them; with these, they're better off separated and with longer handles. Or, if Hori really wanted to push that dockable feature, they should've made the grips with thicker curves that move back than down.<br /><br />After months of switching back and forth, I've decided to stick with my Satisfye grip than these. I still enjoy using these for the fantastic sticks and shoulder buttons. I'm not a fan of the tall buttons (I still often miss presses because of how tall they are to reach), and the d-pad is pretty dang stiff, but I still use the grip at least once a week.",

The sticks here have full axes; they even come with extra nubs that you can swap. I have mine laid out similar to the GameCube sticks: larger left nub, narrow right nub. The back buttons are easy to program and press, though the white-light indicator was pale enough for me to not recognize it at first.<br /><br />The vibration is almost a deal-breaker, however. It's too strong and the instructions that came with don't acknowledge a way to change the intensity. They make the whole grip quake, resulting in an annoying plastic chatter. It deafens a lot of the audio coming from the game. Also, the d-pad is awful. I don't have unintended inputs, but it's almost impossible to do so because the d-pad requires a bit more force than Nintendo's own d-pad. That and the shape of the d-pad itself make it uncomfortable to use for any game that requires long use of it.",

It's great how companies manufacture different ways of making the gaming experience enjoyable.<br /><br />So I'm always down to try a new controller. No controller is ever perfect; I might have a few go-tos for different genres, but having a favorite means I won't have a favorite later. I've read around about this GuliKit controller. The technology checks out: Hall-effect sticks, mechanical buttons, and metal parts? Count me in! It's also in the shape of the Xbox controller, which is super comfortable.<br /><br />In the hand, this controllers feels great. It's got a soft, matte-like texture. It's not rubbery to the touch, but more of a grainy plastic. The area around the sticks are metal, but I'm unsure of the triggers. They feel plastic without me removing them. The buttons feel awesome. They're my favorite next to Nintendo's ABXY buttons. Because the buttons use a mechanical switch, there will be less wear-and-tear in the long run. They can be switched around for an Xbox-style layout, but I'm leaving mine as they came.<br /><br />The sticks are nice and snappy. They always snap into the center and feel good to move. I know they use Hall-effect switches (which also were used in keyboards long ago), and I'm aware of the technology behind it; I have no doubt they will prove better in the long run too, but I'm also curious as to what issues may be presented that haven't yet.<br /><br />There are a couple issues I have with the controller that I'll mention now. One is the positioning of the OS buttons. There's start and minus akin to the Switch, as well as menu, screen-capture, and a controller-setting buttons. I wish the menu and screen-capture buttons were swapped with the start and select buttons. I found myself several times pressing menu or screen capture when I meant to press start and select. The former buttons are placed where start and select normally are (at least for me), so I've had lots of accidental presses. I hope there's an update in the future that lets me customize any button.<br /><br />Another issue is the triggers. The back triggers have too much real estate, leaving the front triggers uncomfortable to press. I know this is completely dependent on the user's hands, but my index fingers rest on the triggers and I have to twist my hand to press the front triggers. This is a problem in games like Metroid Dread, which make heavy use of the front triggers. I know the Switch can swap buttons, but it doesn't eliminate the discomfort.<br /><br />Those are my only issues. Overall, I love this controller. The controller settings are another feature I love. Using just the settings button and other button combos, I can change the vibration intensity (thank you!), the distance of the sticks, and the distance of the back triggers, which I believe are digital with some analog distance. Gyro settings can be adjusted too but I never use that.",

It would almost make sense for Microsoft to sell these with a smaller drive installed, but smaller than 1TB isn't cheaper anyway. I also have a second external drive attached to save game clips. You can record a clip up to one hour long clips with an external drive. It requires separate drives for each purpose, storage and media. For storage, let the XBox One format it. For media, format it as NTFS using a PC. Once a game is installed on the external drive, it can be played on any other XBox One. All video formats will be available, whatever the machine supports.

Both the clip and the magnet are not strong enough to hold the battery in place. Disappointed.",

It took me awhile to figure out the back cushion part snaps in place. Also the battery was not always charging the headset. I would have to push the plug back in for it to start charging again. I do have a protective case over the headset so maybe it is knocking the plug out a little? Overall, the head strap is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. I wasn't crazy about the lights on the back. It's quite bright and since I'm wearing the head strap, I can't see the lights anyway.",

The oldest has been 60 and the youngest has been 6, if that gives you a spectrum how fun it is.  There is fun games for all like (dodge ball, tether ball, slot cars, paper racers, dart shooting, and wall ball).  Dodge ball seems to be the fan favorite as 4 people can play and it gets really competitive (especially when adults are playing).  Anyway, great family game for all ages and I would recommend buying this for your Wii.",

It's a very odd game, it's definetly not like your normal Mario so you have to get use to that. I hadn't read anything about the game before buying it, so I didn't realize that the game is set where you are playing inside Bowser's body.  Hence, \"Bowser Inside story\".  The part I liked about the game the most was the story line.  I never really understood the whole Mario and Bowser thing but the story line in the game definetly helps you understand those dynamics.  However, I must admit if you are buying this for a younger kid, I wouldn't recommend it because it might be hard for them to play.  I am a 30 year old and I struggled at times to understand exactly what I needed to do at points.  It definitely not like \"regular Mario\" so if that's what you are looking for than this game might not be for you.

I was very disappointed and actually have stopped playing it which is something I never do seeing that I have to play the game until I beat it.

Then Steam had to update itself. Then I was forced to create a Steam account, not that I wanted or needed one. Then the game installed. Once the game was installed it then updated the game, without asking.<br /><br />After finally getting it installed I attempted to run the game and start a single player game. When the Steam program came up I tried starting an offline session but the game would then just quit out to Windows. I could not find a way to play, alone on my computer, without allowing some 3rd party software free and completely unnecessary access to the internet. I don't know what information they harvested but I hope they choke on it. I should have just stopped there.<br /><br />Finally deciding to take the risk I allowed Steam to make a connection, logged into THAT so I could not play online and started a single player game. What a total disappointment. Long boring cut-scenes, dull graphics and the humor that made the original so great was so OVER done, so blatantly bad it wasn't fun or amusing it was just pathetic. I played for a short time, about 30% of which was spent twiddling my thumbs watching cut-scenes and finally gave up, quit the game, uninstalled it (which went far faster than the installation) broke the disc in half and tossed the thing in the trash can.<br /><br />I waited all those years for this?<br /><br />This game is not worth buying.

I often need to use my phone when it's charging and having a straight plug sticking out of the bottom of the phone is annoying and I worried about damaging the port. Thought a 90° bend cable would give me the best of both worlds. Unfortunately the plug end is just too short to use with the Otterbox case I have on the phone. The base of the plug hangs up on the edge of the case and the slightest touch rocks the plug out of contact. It worked ok with my tablet which also uses USB-C charging but I need one cable here in the back room to swap between devices and I'm stuck with the old straight cable.

Then the mics - they're MUCH heavier - perhaps 5-10x as heavy as the K-R microphones, and much bigger meaning harder to store when you put everything away.<br /><br />The game itself, well it's not really a game.  It's just karaoke.  K-R is a game, where you compete, unlock things, win trophies, etc.  SS does allow you unlock a few songs, but the gameplay is boring and unfulfilling.<br /><br />The scoring is obnoxious and annoying compared to K-R as well.  It grades 10x more for singing the exact PHRASING as the original than singing on pitch.<br /><br />Go buy a PS2 - they're terrific.

It doesn't have the same graphics, but 4X type games are not supposed to be graphics masterpieces, so I don't miss much there.

It also gave us the first appearance of heros.<br /><br />Many of hte original writeups about Elemental suggested that it was going to be the sequel to Master of Magic.  I looked forward to getting it, as I love this type of game, and trying to run the odl Dos Master of Magic on my computer doesn't work all that well.<br /><br />Sadly, when Elemental first came out it did have major bugs taht left the game nearly unplayable.  Fortunately Stardock didn't quit on the game and they have made numerous refinements and improvements.  I have no had a crash in months, and the game appears stable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it still is no Master of Magic.  The races are divided effectively into a light and dark side and the dark \"Empire\" races have a huge initial advantage due to their tech tree.  They don't get some of hte top Techs that the light \"Kingdom\" races can obtain if they have enough time, but they do have a huge early advantage.<br /><br />It doesn't help taht the AI isn't very good especially at dealing with a well organized \"stack of death\".  If you have time to put together a powerful stack of 8-9 high level units, you can easily crush anything the computer sends against you.  Tactics tend to be simple.  Keep one stack together and build it up to a high level doing quests and killing the wandering monsters until its powerful enough to kill anything it faces.<br /><br />The game is in my mind better than Civ V.  It doesn't have the city states, but it offers more choices in the city management and tech choices.<br /><br />A good game, but not a great one.  I hate that I paid full price considering what I know now, but its not a horrible deal either.",

The game itself is not completely unique, but it is rare.  Crafting is simple, but a good deal of planning must go into obtaining the resources for many of the best items, and obtaining recipes usually means completing quests for the games NPCs.  Getting those quests usually requires a high level of friendship with the NPC, so again, there's a lot of planning to put into the game.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the camera issue others have noted.  You have limited control of the camera and there have been times I got stuck behind a wall until I could get the camera to rotate the view.  Frustrating, but hardly a game breaker.",

The AI is not well programmed and the computer races will regularly take actions that display the limitations of the programming.  Worse, there are times that no computer race will sign a treaty with you, even though you have been perfectly honorable up to that point.  I have played several games where at some point I'm ready to pull my hair out because of the illogic the computer uses.  It even extends to surrendering.  You could have the last 1-2 worlds of one computer race surrounded and he'll suddenly surrender to a third race rather than allow you to defeat him.  This is extremely frustrating, especially if you are trying to get a conquest win as you then have to start a new war with an enemy who might have been a friend up to that point.<br /><br />Still, its fun, has an amazing amount of detail and technologies to research, and does not have a vertical learning curve.  If you like 4X games, its worth looking into, but those who don't have the patience for the slow pace of most turn-based games should avoid this.",

It's simple to play, and entertaining.<br /><br />However, it isn't a deep game, nor does it really present challenges which offer a feelign of reward when they are completed.  Despite the quest system laid over the Sims engine, this game has a limited range of options.<br /><br />I am not even sure I'd say this is a \"simulation\" game, even through it claims to be the Sims.  You decide what path your sim will follow when you create them.  To play you ahve to select a quest from a list of 6 that will be avaiable, dependent on what buildings and sims you have available.  Completion of quests improves your kingdom and gives you money that can be used to purchase food and furniture for your sim.<br /><br />The quests are rather straightforward and usually have a combination of 4 basic steps.<br />1) go to a location<br />2) obtain certain items<br />3) talk to certain sims<br />4) interact with an event point or person (may include fighting)<br /><br />Finishing a quest with a high score requires concentrating on the steps while keeping your sim fed, and entertained.  Depending on the \"fatal flaw\" you have your sims that could be harder.  Some flaws have a greater effect than others.<br /><br />As I said, i have had fun playing hte game and exploring the world, but it is limited.  This game is not one that truly offers an infinite amount of gameplay.  Eventually even with new quests there just won't be anything that feels \"new\" available to perform.  The achievements are interesting, but most just require that you play a certain amount ot time to achieve.  A few require planning, but are otherwise achievable.<br /><br />I'd say this game is good for lovers of Sims2 and Sims3, not bad for those who like RPGs and want to try one that's a bit more talk than fight, but will definitely bore those who enjoy the energy rush of first-person shooters and sports games.",

In style of play it most resembles Elemental or Civ V than other older turn-based 4X games.<br /><br />I have to say that I liked elemenats of hte game, but could not call this a masterpiece.  The standard for most fantasy 4X games is still Master of Magic.  Yes, the graphics are terrible, but the shear number of races and spells and the addition of heroes made the game a huge step up compared to the other options.  Age of Wonders tries to capture the same elements, but for me it never quite achieved the same elegance.<br /><br />Warlock doesn't try to be as expansive as Master of Magic.  There are only 3 races and no technology tree.  The only research is for spells, and the research tree is rather linear, you see 5 options to research and from what I could see the system works by a \"researched X spell and spell X+1 appears in the tree.  The spells appear to follow a very linear tech tree.<br /><br />Combat is not much different than Civ V, the lack of stacking makes it a bit more tactically than Civ IV, but it's still rather straightforward in execution.<br /><br />Honestly, this feels like it could have been a lot better if more time had been spent expanding options.  The lack of races, the lack of a tech tree, the linear nature of spell research, all leaft me thinking the game could be so much more.<br /><br />But I love 4X games, so I still enjoy this one.  It plays faster and smoother than Elemental, and while lacking in some elements, does not have the same balance issues that make Elemental nearly impossible to enjoy.<br /><br />If you like 4X games, and like the idea of adding magic, this is worth trying.

I presume that this is just in case you are not totally happy with your first attempt at installing this product.<br /><br />That is sort of what happened to me.  I installed the first tempered glass screen protector fairly easily.. except for the fact that I ended up with one small piece of dust that became trapped beneath the screen protector during installation.<br /><br />I must stress that this error was due solely to my own actions, and not because of any flaws in the product.  It was due to my inexperience.<br /><br />I ultimately ended up removing by screen protector completely, which of course rendered the first tempered glass screen protector useless. And I started over fresh, using second tempered glass screen protector contained in the set.<br /><br />My second attempt at installing this item was successful.. and I am very pleased with the end result!<br /><br />I was able to find a video on YouTube detailing how to install a tempered glass screen protector on the Nintendo Switch.. using what was called the &#34;Hinge Method&#34;.  (The &#34;Hinge Method&#34; basically involves using some tape to secure the screen protector securely to the Nintendo Switch during installation.. and I recommend using this method.)<br /><br />This screen protector seems to be a really Wonderful and well made product!

Installation is so easy that anyone who can read Basic English can complete it in minutes, including reading time and putting in the two AA batteries which are included in the package.  Quadruple your time if you're counting the time it takes to open the tightly sealed packaging as this may require the use of power tools. (Slight exaggeration)<br /><br />After releasing the controller from bondage and putting in the batteries the right way, simply plug the receiver into the slot where the old wired controller used to be, and you're good to go.<br /><br />My son, the resident expert, reports better control, better feel and better buttons, and I guess he likes it because he disappeared with it into his room, and we've had a peaceful day since then.<br /><br />Instead of sitting up close to the TV, he can now sit way back on the bed in royal comfort, and best of all, I know I won't be risking my neck tripping over wires as I pass through the war zone.  Another thing that I can say is majorly cool and improved is the vibration feature.  I received permission to hold it and push a few buttons during a game, and this feature really put me in the game.  After being rescued from peril by an exasperated child, I retired hurt, but very pleased with this controller.<br /><br />Two minor cons are keeping track of the controller without using a tracking device or bloodhound, and having to change the batteries every 45-50 hours of playing time.

(I think they made it personal)<br /><br />All these games have an aerobic and physical element, and if you don't get yer lazy azz in gear, nothing much happens.  Bowling for instance, requires you to swing the controller like you would a bowling ball (making sure that you secure it around your wrist first so you don't put a hole in your TV), and after hours of unaccustomed exercise, your muscles can really feel the burn.  And it's not only your arm muscles.  One does not bowl without the correct body language after all.<br /><br />Oh the pain!!<br /><br />Now they're looking at all the other doo-dads and wing-dings to further their Wii experience, and making strong birthday and father's day hints.

The base is uncomfortable for small hands, especially for the baseball grip.<br />4. You lose the vibration effect<br />5. In baseball, you have to take the controller out of the handle to pitch, or else look rather silly pitching with a bat in your hand.  It doesn't take long, but it's something you don't need to do if you're not using the accessory.<br />6. You'll need to take the controller out of the padded sleeve before using these accessories. (And then put it back on when you're through)<br /><br />The bottom line is that these accessories add nothing to the Wii Sports experience, and you're much better off keeping things simple and using the regular remote controller on its own.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 7, 2009",

After trying a couple of other shooting games with the Wii pistol attachment for the Wii Remotes, \"Dead Space Extraction\" is the winner! This game is by far the best of all the games we've tried, including those that are not in the shooting categories.<br /><br />The graphics are amazing, the story line was quick-paced, made sense and the story actually had us wanting to know more. We loved being able to play side by side on a single screen without having to do the whole split screen effect - each of us has our own cross-hairs to aim and shoot the aliens with, but on one screen so we can make full use of the 50\" television. The other nice thing about this game was that the main characters change without losing the flow of the story and the point of the game - keeps things interesting and stirs up the skill set. There are multiple difficulty levels here as well so when you think you've mastered it, you can come back and let it kick your butt all over again. SO GLAD WE BOUGHT THIS ONE!",

This \"Call of Duty - World at War\" has turned out to be a great game!<br /><br />Both of us play this one alone and together at the same time and we've been having a blast with it either way. The story line is engaging, the graphics are excellent on a large high def television, we've definately found ourselves laughing at the humor (maybe inappropriately, but who cares, it's a GAME!) and laughing at each other as we play through the campaigns, the difficulty level is about right for first time gamers. We're challenged, but not to the point of frustration or watching my husband fling the Wii out a window. One of things I really like is that we can play together at the same time with two targets on a single screen - no split screens here.<br /><br />One hint - We did buy the smaller pistol type guns to use with this one rather than the big Wii Zapper contraption which really makes the game so much better! When we conquer this one, we'll definately move on and buy the next verson of the \"Call of Duty\" game.",

As adults with our first game system, we purchased several games in different genres for our new Wii system. We bought one of the other Resident Evil titles and loved it, so this one seemed like a natural choice due to the rave reviews and the first person shooter perspective. I love the graphics here - it's very easy to get sucked into the world and the feel of the game without question. Especially if you have the opportunity to set it up on a Hi-Def large screen television - gorgeous.<br /><br /> However, this is a hard game! It's not a game for beginners unless you just enjoy frustration and shrieking at the tv and starting over again and again and again. The little tricks and subtle ins and outs that long time gamers all pick up as they play game after game after game hours on end seem to be needed and assumed for Resident Evil 4. That in and of itself is not a dealbreaker, just something I wish I had known ahead of time - I would have waited and purchased this game later on. What ended up happening is we got frustrated and stuck at the first village, stopped playing the game for a couple of months, conquered some others, learned some gaming tricks in general and have now come back to Resident Evil 4 with a fresh perspective and attitude and we're enjoying it much more the second time around. So.... not a game a for first timers, but one worth playing when you've gotten your feet wet elsewhere first.",

I have to admit that this is one amazing-looking thing!<br /><br />All thumbs up as far as appearance.  After he has used it a little while longer,<br />I'll add his comments about the performance.  Meanwhile - love it. Wish I had one<br />in green for Mom!<br /><br />UPDATE:  We have now purchased the RED Lava Glow as well.<br />Both of the controllers look great while playing in a darkened room.<br />No complaints of any kind so far on either button response or durability.<br />But then, the users in our house are older, not little kids, so maybe little ones are<br />rougher on them.<br /><br />We enjoy all of the specialty controllers we've purchased here on Amazon.<br />We have both red and blue lava glow, as well as the white and the black iGlow.<br />GREAT controllers that make the game better somehow.",

                "text": "Well, this game was kind of fun, even if only for the challenge of completing a level.<br /><br />I have now finished level 100 and \"been accepted as one of the gods\" (per the game).<br /><br />The game was fun enough. It is a standard make-a-match-of-at-least-three icons.<br />The things are kind of small (at least for my eyes), and I wished I could enlarge the game!<br />When the chains are over the icons, you can barely make out what it is. I had to go by the colors.<br /><br />That being said, the documentation that comes with the game is THE PITS. It tells only the most<br />basic information, things you automatically know if you have ever played any sort of electronic game.<br />The game itself has a few notes that show up as a pop-up screen while you are playing.<br />It is okay if you memorize everything, but I know I couldn't do it all!<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the MANUAL should tell you what all those bloomin' power-ups on the<br />side actually do!  It doesn't. When you use one, it moves so quickly, you can't really tell what it<br />did. I finally got it that the globe-type ball will destroy something like 11 tiles around whereever<br />you place it. The hourglass gives you an unknown additional amount of time to complete the level.<br /><br />The rest?  I don't know - they go too fast - I can't follow them.<br />The flame burns some icons up, but which ones? I don't know.<br />The purple globe does something, but no clue what.<br />And on it goes...<br />So, using them strategically is really hard!<br /><br />I think a game is a lot more fun when it is explained thoroughly so I know what the goal<br />actually is - not a random stab at completion.<br /><br />I am in the process of going through the game again under a diff ID to write things<br />down as the screens pop up. Seriously, how hard would that have been for the developers to do?!?<br />Basic documentation of the game, and it is missing.<br /><br />It was okay, but never pay a huge amount for the game, and know that it is going to be<br />a stab in the dark the first time through.",

I had the Athens game and wanted to see how<br />this one went.<br /><br />First off, my game was faulty.  Since I had already left a review for the seller<br />(that I apparently cannot change) and had the game for a while before I played it,<br />I guess I am stuck.  Many of the sidebar bonus items don't work - they only show up<br />as a half an item, or just sit there, without being able to drag them to the game.<br /><br />But overall, getting back to the game alone, it is just another one of the games<br />that you drag/swap to make matches of three or more like items.<br />You buy/build your port city while you progress through the levels.<br /><br />Many of the levels are a little hard to see because of the small icons<br />and the color combinations (like blue items on a blue background). The \"cure\" for this<br />issue is to restart that level 0 it shuffles and you'll get a different color screen.<br /><br />Overall, my rating is \"eh\".<br />I would not buy it again, and don't think all that much of the game.",

                "text": "I love to play games of all kinds, but many of the DS games are just not my style.<br />(I am one of the few people around that don't really care for Mario, I suppose!  Jumping<br />for coins or mushrooms just isn't my thing.)<br /><br />This game is absolutely crammed with brain teasers.  Nothing that would take a PhD to solve, and<br />they vary in difficulty from easy to super hard. The difficulty is rated in \"picarats\", the point system<br />the game uses.<br /><br />Like other Layton games, there is a mystery to solve. However, this one had a lot more to do than the<br />Curious Village game.  There are extra games in Layton's \"trunk\", and you have to find ingredients to brew<br />various teas. In the course of the game you will come across characters that are thirsty and really want a nice<br />cuppa tea of some sort. It will be your job to brew what they want. If you serve the right one, it will unlock<br />yet another puzzle.<br /><br />I finished Curious Village completely in about 16 hours of play time. (I wasn't rushing, but still wasn't all that<br />hard.) So far, I have been playing for about 22 hours, and still not completed. This is just more fun. You can keep<br />going back to places you've already been to, and there will be another puzzle.<br /><br />There is also a place to collect pieces of a camera that was \"dropped\". Once you reassemble the camera, there are<br />several places where you can take a \"photo\".  That is yet another part of the game - you then compare the real scene<br />with the photo you took, and spot three differences. If you get them all (per photo and there are 12), it unlocks yet<br />another puzzle.<br /><br />I really truly love this series, and hope they continue to make them every year.<br />I can hardly wait for the next two. These are a little pricey, but honestly, they are worth it.<br />Lots of fun game play. All the puzzles are woven into a storyline that involves a lot of characters to solve<br />the mystery.<br /><br />If you like brain teasers or even puzzles like Hi-Q, get this game. You won't be sorry.",

I believe my gameplay time was 60 hours, mostly because I wanted explore every nook of the game.<br /><br />I just finished Dragon Age II this afternoon in 35 hours of playtime.  I COULD have played longer, but was getting incredibly bored with doing the same types of quests in the same locations over and over again, so I ultimately chose to just head for the endgame and get it over with.<br /><br />With Dragon Age: Origins you had a sense of purpose and a goal you felt you were reaching for...<br /><br />In Dragon Age II you feel as if you are wandering about aimlessly doing quests for cash, because in reality that is what you are doing most of the time.<br /><br />[tiny spoiler in next paragraph]<br /><br />About 30% of the way into the game you feel as if you are finally breaking away from the city, when you join an expedition into the deep roads.  I was excited when this part came up as I felt it was going to lead to the rest of the quest.. however, once you are done with the expedition, you go BACK to the city and start doing the repetitive questing again until the end of the game.<br /><br />After 30 hours, the game started to feel really \"grindy\", just doing stuff so you can gain levels.. cash.. and equipment.  If I want to grind I will go play an MMORPG.. PS3 games shouldn't have these aspects as part of the basic gameplay.  Now that I am done, I have no desire to go back and play again with a different strategy.  Of the 35 hours I played... I'd say 30 of them were spent in the exact same locations doing the same thing.<br /><br />With the above said.. it is not ALL bad.  The graphics were fantastic.  The characters were interesting and fun.. especially the interplay between them.  The fighting was ramped up a lot from the first version, making it a nice challenge at times and I was really enjoying it up until [same small spoiler about to happen] you wind up BACK in town after finally getting out of that place.<br /><br />Overall.. if you are just looking for the Dragon Age experience... it will fill that void.  However, if you are looking for an epic storyline and lots of adventure... find something else.  This will likely frustrate you more than you will enjoy it.",

                "text": "Leaving my previous review below, because it was written before patch 1.2 and what this game was to become, so you can read my original optimism!<br /><br />What ruined potential.  Once you hit level 50, the game becomes an absolute mindless grind, with no sense of purpose at all.  It is one thing to do the same raids over and over if they are fun or have purpose, but it loses its luster quickly and becomes the usual (stand on the x, hit the 3 key seven times, then the 5 key times and then stand on spot Y).  The PvP (basically now reduced to warzones ONLY) have absolutely no sense of purpose, except to grind for gear.  They are supposedly introducing \"team\" play, but they missed the opportunity to have a overall purpose to the PvP, such as helping your chosen FACTION.  Open world PvP is non-existent and had no sense of purpose either.<br /><br />For a game that started off telling an amazing story... it completely loses its way towards the end and you just don't care about what happens anymore.<br /><br />Space combat.. great potential gone wrong.  You wind up repeating the exact same space missions during your initial progressions.  (The level 40 missions are the exact same as the level 20 missions, just with slightly higher goals (kill 40 fighters instead of 20).<br /><br />When they added content to the story in patch 1.2.. I didn't both to complete it as I had stopped caring about the storyline.<br /><br />It's a shame, because this could have been a fantastic game, but they took the easy way out and decided to turn it into a mindless grind.<br /><br />This is defiantly one of the better MMO's and has some aspects that make it much better than the rest.<br /><br />The Best Aspects:<br /><br />The story line is fantastic and the voice acting makes it much more enthralling than other games which simply present you with a wall of text.  It maintains the feel of both an MMO and single player game.<br /><br />Crafting.  Finally a game got this right.  You don't have to spend endless boring hours grinding away at resource gathering and standing over a forge.  You get companions in the game and send them on missions and they gather the resources for you and craft the items, earning you experience.  This is the first MMO where I am actually doing the crafting.<br /><br />They have nice bonus systems to encourage you to group, but you don't HAVE TO if you don't want to in order to complete your story line.  (If you group with others you earn experience from them completing quests as well as you own, so you level much faster!)<br /><br />The Good Aspects:<br /><br />Space combat is a lot of fun, but isn't fleshed out yet.  You can do space missions, but are essentially stuck on a rail as your ship steers itself through space and you control where and what you shoot, with small room for movements.<br /><br />Characters are pretty customizable, as you can switch your skill tree.  So you can go up the healing tree and then decide you want to do DPS and go back to your trainer and spend some credits to reassign your skills. (You get the first swap for free).  You can also create interesting hybrid characters, who can serve dual purposes.<br /><br />What needs work:<br /><br />The PVP just isn't there yet.  There isn't anything to encourage people into open world PvP, so it is pretty much restricted to \"warzones\".  These are mini, repeatable instances where they put equal number of republic and empire and give them a goal to achieve.  Great idea.. execution isn't there yet.  There is no in game voice communication, so you get thrown into a random group and then it becomes difficult to execute because you can't communicate quickly.  Further they put people of all levels into the same warzone and although they scale your HP up to level 50, unless you are level 50, your gear and skills aren't on par.  (Hopefully they will bracket the warzones in the future to make them more balanced).<br /><br />Overall, however, this is a great game that has lots of potential.  Hopefully they resist the urge to go with other MMO's have gone before them and just turn it into a constant grind for gear.  Right now, it isn't grindy and that alone makes it worth playing!",

                "text": "This is a game that had a TON of potential, but completely missed the mark.<br /><br />I was extremely excited for all that this game promise.. This game promises No Classes, No Levels, Total Freedom of Play...the reality of the game is quite different.<br /><br />I think everyone understood there was some wiggle room in their marketing statements, as there would be some type of progression and \"leveling\", which there is.  Instead of the traditional leveling, you earn Skill Points and Ability points and apply them to a \"skill wheel\", which unlocks different skills for different weapons.  This ultimately allows for a single character to take on any role in the game.. wanna be a tank, switch weapons, wanna be a healer, switch weapons, so the only real reason to create an \"alt\" is to join a different faction or for cosmetic purposes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where the game goes horribly wrong is in the forced progression curve, which winds up being far more restrictive and linear than many of the other MMORPG's I played (including SWTOR, which had a very linear and specific storyline to follow).<br /><br />The usual MMO experience is you move into a zone, pick up all the quests, do the quests, gain experience \"clear\" the zone and then move onto the next, harder zone.  Some people choose to focus on one quest at a time, some people follow a specific storyline, and some people grab everything in place and grind through quests as fast as possible... Secret World is NO DIFFERENT in set up.  If you do not clear most of the zone, you will not be powerful enough to move onto the next zone.  However, unlike other MMO's, Secret World restricts HOW you go through the zone and forces you to constantly backtrack in a forced time sink.<br /><br />In The Secret World, you accept mission A from character A. On the way to your objective you encounter character B who requests you also to complete a task at the same place. You go to accept this new missions thinking \"cool, I can kill two birds with one stone\" and you get a warning window that you must \"pause\" quest A to accept quest B. If you choose to pause quest A and take quest B, you have to go back to character A to \"unpause\" quest A, leaving you to run back and forth over the same ground several times... and it isn't just character A and B, you come across character C, D, E, F and G along the way and each time you talk to them you are told you can't accept their missions without abandoning the mission you are on... Freedom of play? Why can't I get BOTH bandages and medication from the pharmacy at the same time?? No, I have to get the bandages, return them to character A, then find character D again, go back to the same pharmacy and find the medication and return it to character D and then hunt out character B who wanted water from the store which was right next to the pharmacy.<br /><br />The developers have offered several conflicting excuses for this baffling limitation, everything from \"memory problems on the backend\" to it being a high level decision made to force you to get immersed in each mission, instead of treating characters like mission hubs. Ultimately, one honest dev admitted that if they removed the limitation it would break the progression curve and they would have to reduce the amount of experience you gained from each mission and people would complain there isn't enough content. (ie, we need to force you to run back and forth because you would progress through the game too fast if we allowed you to follow a logical progression.)<br /><br />This brings me back to the main selling point... \"TOTAL FREEDOM OF PLAY\" If I am someone who chooses to grind quests, why is there something wrong with that? If am someone who WANTS to focus on one quest at a time, great. If I want to do 3 at a time, why am I not allowed to make that choice? They made it 100% clear in the forums that this system was NOT up for debate and would NOT be changed under any circumstances.  This non-intuitive questing system made the game feel like work, rather than fun. I was looking for a game that offered more freedom of gameplay and this felt exactly the opposite.",

                "text": "This review is based on the final beta weekend, which after playing I decided to go ahead and pre-purchase, but the game is not without some flaws, yet it is far FAR better than other recent offers in this genre (The Secret World I am looking in your direction!).<br /><br />The graphics are well done and you really get a good sense of an immense world... it ALMOST felt too big and the directions you could go were fairly limitless.<br /><br />The questing system was one of the better ones, as it gave you enough guidance to get you where you needed to go, but not so much that it was holding your hand.  Further, you felt free to pursue whatever quests you wanted without being forced in a particular direction.<br /><br />The game makes use of dynamic events, which is a little similar to rift, in that SOMETHING happens nearby and asks all nearby players to work towards a common goal.  These are often helpful in also completing your quests.  However, on the downside, I felt they relied on the dynamic events a little TOO MUCH, as it seemed one was popping up every 5 minutes, making them quickly become less of a special thing and more common place.  Spacing them out more (maybe 1 or 2 per hour) would make them feel more special.  Withing a few hours of questing, I was starting to ignore the onscreen notification of \"an event is taking place nearby\".<br /><br />I really liked the PvP systems they developed for this game.  First you have an arena style pvp zone, where you automatically get pumped up to top level, given all your skills and given the high end gear for your character.  There are several different \"capture the flag\" style zones that you can jump right into and start pvp'ing as soon as you get into the game.  In this same zone they also have tournament PvP, where you can get together with a pre-made group and battle other pre-made groups in the same zones.  ( I spent most of my time during this beta in this zone so I could get an idea of the full capabilities of all the classes and once I got my grove, it was a blast!)<br /><br />Secondly in PvP you have a WvWvW (world v world v world) system in which your entire server battles against other servers for dominance by capturing forts and key points on a map from one another.  This really adds a added bonus to the game in that you feel a greater sense of purpose in joining with people on your own server to work together towards a common goal.  There is no need to party up or join a raid, but you can still join in the battle and work together.<br /><br />For me, the biggest negative, and the only reason I give this game only 3 stars is that in a decision to \"break the mold\" of MMORPGs the developers decided to do away with the \"holy trinity\" of DPS/TANK/HEALER and rather make each class self-sufficient.  While I completely appreciate the thought, I don't think it quite worked out the way they planned and it seemed to do more to frustrate gameplay a little bit.  While I agree that the idea of \"needing a healer\" or \"needing a tank\" to complete a raid or form a team needs to change, trying to completely eliminate these roles really diminishes the fun for people (like me) who flat out LIKE playing the healer or tank.  This is where I felt The Secret World had a great idea (keep the basic dynamic, but allowing a character change professions on the fly), but they screwed up the questing system so much they made the game unplayable.  So.. if you are someone who likes playing a healer or a tank, this game will be a little frustrating, because the playstyle you have become used to isn't supported here.<br /><br />Further, it seems that while they eliminated \"traditional\" roles, class makeup still seemed to play a HUGE role in who won matches.  Two Guardians (the closest they have to a \"tank class\" could essentially act as a single tank for an entire party (by chaining their conditional removal and regeneration efforts, they become almost unbeatable) and Warriors, when paired with elementalists, could deliver HUGE burst DPS through combinations... so while the stated goal of not having a healing class or a tank class was to remove the necessity of particular group make ups, there is STILL the necessity of group make ups if you want to win matches.<br /><br />In short, while each individual class is nicely balanced against each other (no one class is really OP), group makeup still plays the primary role in how you will succeed and if you don't have the right class composition, you are going to lose your match, thus undermining the entire reason they eliminated the \"holy trinity\" to begin with.<br /><br />While these are problems with the game play, it is still a fun game with lots of potential.  For a \"beta\" it seemed EXTREMELY polished and ready to go.  I am looking forward to seeing the final release.",

                "text": "This really is a fun game to play in many different ways, but they had several great ideas, that just didn't appear to be executed in the best possible way.  Some of these are easily fixed... some are built into the game structure and make it less fun than it could be.<br /><br />On the PvE side of things, they have a fun and interesting storyline and LOTS to explore.  Almost TOO MUCH too explore.  In order to \"complete\" a map (which you get rewards for), you have to find every point of interest, every vista (a lookout point that you have to jump to), complete every quest, find every waypoint (travel spots), and earn every skill point.  Those who love exploring, will, no doubt find this tons of fun.  However, if you JUST follow your storyline, you quickly find that you wind up in areas far above your level, so it becomes in your best interest to either gain experience by completing the map OR finding another \"starter zone\" to do early quests.  I am not a fan of being forced backwards before moving on and would rather the storyline flow more with your leveling, BUT they give you so many different ways to earn experience, that isn't so much of a drag that it brings you down.  You also have \"Dynamic events\" that pop up and you can join in and help.  (ie, minotaurs are invading and you need to help stop them).<br /><br />I wanted to add a little more in here, in regards to the \"completion\" of a map and something I learned which is both good and bad.  When you \"complete\" a map, I mentioned you get rewards.  Those rewards are geared to your level.  So, if you complete maps as you go along you will get random rewards for your level, which likely aren't worth much, because you level very quickly... However, IF you don't finish anything and then wait until level 80 to complete the zones... THEN you get very valuable rewards.  Nice for people who rushed through early and then decide to go back and find all the vistas and points of interest... kinda sucky for people who spent the time to fully explore their maps at the lower levels.<br /><br />There are 3 parts of the PvP world.  First, there is tournament style Structured PvP, where your pre-made group of 5 faces off against another pre-made group.  This can be fun, but quite annoying, as I will explain more below due to balance issues.  Second, there is open PvP servers where you join a server and it randomly puts you on the red or blue team and you fight to control points.  You may switch teams in the middle of a match, or from map to map.  This is kinda fun, but again, due to some balance and mechanics issues I have with the game, not as fun as it could be.  Then there is WvWvW (world v world v world), which is, by far, the most fun part of the game, where you join with your entire server to control points on a map and score points against other servers.  Unfortunately, current queue times to get into WvWvW range from 3-5 hours, so, at the moment, getting in to play this aspect of the game is like winning the lottery.  I am sure they will fix this will time, because that type of wait time is obviously unacceptable.<br /><br />So.. what are the problems?<br /><br />The dynamic events are too frequent and too repetitive.  They are a really cool aspect of the game, but the novelty of them wears off quickly and you find yourself starting to ignore them after just a few hours of play.  Worse, the same events pop up over and over and over again in the same spots.  One particularly annoying one is right by the crafting stations and it won't let you craft until the \"event\" is over and it seems as if every time I hop over to craft, the \"event\" is happening.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the game that won't change and will frustrate many MMORPG gamers.  They have done away with the \"holy trinity\" of Tank/Heals/DPS and given each class abilities to self heal, group heal, CC, tank, etc.  There are some \"tankier\" classes and some that are more useful with group heals, but nothing like what you are used to.  If you LIKED playing a healer or tank in previous games, you are likely to find GW2 quite frustrating... DPS is king here... You can put together some burst DPS builds that can bring down someone in seconds (or fractions of seconds), with little they can do about it.  You have \"control\" and \"support\" roles, but in the end, a group of burst DPS thieves or life steal necromancers is going to roll over even the most skilled and \"balanced\" team.<br /><br />Which brings me to what I mentioned earlier about balance.  \"Build\" is king in this game.  Even though everyone in SPvP is boosted to level 80 and given access to all the same weapons and their full skill trees... Which weapons you choose, which skills you slot and which traits you boost will 95% determine your dominance in PvP... skill is secondary to build.  Having the right build will overpower skill nearly every time.  My friend linked me a burst dps warrior built which I created and within minutes was dominating in PvP only having to press 3 keys over and over again.  Maybe to some people spending hours going over different combinations of skills/traits/weapons to come up with the one that gives you the highest crit chance, coupled with the most vitality and toughness seems like fun.  However, I just want to PLAY the game.  So, yes, it is great that the give you lots of choices and the ability to create your own role, but I don't see any way they are every going to achieve true balance, there is going to be a constant flux of nerfing and buffing.  In the build up to the game and interviews, this seemed to be exactly what they were trying to avoid, but maybe it is just an inevitability with MMORPGS?<br /><br />So at the end of the day... it is a really fun game, but not without some serious flaws some of which are part of the design and some which will likely never be completely fixed.",

Now that I understand it, I don't have a single complaint.  The Windows 7 x64 drivers installed without a glitch as did the programming software.<br /><br />I like that I was able to change the palm rest to make it higher than normal and I was able to adjust the side buttons forward to put them in just the right place.  In the 4 hours I've been using it, it has used 17% of the charge in one battery, not too bad in my opinion.  I look forward to using more as so far I am very pleased.<br /><br />UPDATE:  It's 3 days later and I am in the process of returning it.  I like it, a lot.  I like how it feels and moves and nearly everything about it, except;  Whenever I swap batteries when I plug the one to be charged into the receiver it disconnects from windows so I have to crawl under the desk and unplug/re-plug the usb cable.  Mad Catz support told me they think it is a defective receiver but will not send a replacement unless I first send them this one.  Thankfully Amazon is replacing it free of charge.<br /><br />UPDATE 2:  A month later, problems are solved and I am loving this mouse.  As others have mentioned, battery life could be better but so far it's fine with me.  Going back up to 5 stars.",

                "text": "First off I want to note that I got this when it was priced at $29.99, perhaps the best deal I've ever got on a keyboard.  I replaced a CM Storm Trigger with this after the Storm developed connection issues after only 3 months, probably the worst deal I've ever got on a keyboard.<br /><br />I wish I had bought this one first because I like it better than the cm storm.  It's much lighter and much, much easier to program.  Obviously it doesn't have the nice cherry switches like the storm does and I am concerned on how long it will last, but it's a great keyboard and the touch is fine, I can't complain.<br /><br />At first I was worried about the green lighting, I thought it would look strange and be hard to see.  To my surprise it looks great and is very easy to see.  To my eyes I'd have to say it's easier to see than either red or blue light, both of which I've had before.<br /><br />And because I do all my typing with the keyboard resting between my indian style crossed legs it's light weight is great, so much better than having 3 pounds of keyboard digging into my legs.<br /><br />The only CON I've found is sometimes when I type the keys will squeak a little and that is a bit annoying.  If it ever gets bad I'll just pull the caps and touch the springs up with a bit of oil.<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't buy 2 or 3 of them when they were priced so low.",

                "text": "I had really hoped for more from this game.  Sadly it's more or less Civ 5 in new clothes with most of Civ 5's best features lost in the translation.  Same as many others I've waited years for them to \"finish\" civ 5 and thought this would be a good culmination of their work.  Wrong!  This is more like starting over with a big step backwards.<br /><br />I regret giving them my 50 bucks for this, it should have been downloadable content for civ 5.  At least then some of the polish they'd achieved would have been carried over.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Minus another star, was 3 now 2.  I've played several games of this new civ so far, they go much faster than usual.  There are some neat things and now that I've got used to the interface it's ok too.  What isn't ok is having to play on only random maps.  No scenarios, no meticulously setting up the perfect game.  And I'm sorry to say, random gets boring and repetitive very fast.<br /><br />Hopefully soon they will release a map and scenario editor and given things like that have, for a very long time, been a part of Sid Meier's Civilization, it's pretty lame they release this game without it.  IMHO.<br /><br />2nd UPDATE:  It's been a month now and still no update so there goes another star.<br /><br />On a positive note, the game does play nicely.  It moves along with an ease I've not before noticed in any civ and the soft sounds for events don't make me cringe.",

                "text": "&#34;Wow,&#34; is the best I can think of to say about this game.  It's really something and I like it a lot.  Usually I only play serious strategy games such as Civilization and my past forays into console games have been far less than satisfactory.  Thanks to the other reviewers here I decided to give this one a try and I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />At first I was wondering if it is just an interactive story.  I'm not much for the story aspects of games and it took several scenes before actual game play comes up.  Surprisingly, I held in there and after the first couple short missions I was hooked.  The story itself is not overly original but also not so common as to be boring.  The main characters are likeable enough and as things progressed I found myself interested in what was going on and anxious to find out what would happen next.<br /><br />So then, the Pros:  The Graphics, great!  I wasn't sure what to think of the watercolor/cartoon/anime mix at first but after seeing it in action I'm hooked.  While most modern games seem to be going for the &#34;real as life&#34; look this game looks softer, less in your face.  Also on the plus side of things is the ease of play.  It was easy to learn how things work and to understand the goals and objectives set out.  I got an Xbox controller to use with it, my first time ever using one, and I'm having a great time with it.<br /><br />Another plus, to me, is the music.  I often turn the music or all sound off when playing games because I usually find it distracting or somehow undesirable.  This one is different and interesting is that parts of the music, while certainly different, is reminiscent of songs I've heard, some old and some not so old.<br /><br />On the Cons side of things I'm coming up a little short.  I would prefer to not have go through a configuration launcher every time and sometimes the story plays on emotions in ways I'd rather it didn't.  Sometimes the story scenes are a bit long and I would get impatient for the next mission.  And of course there's always those times such as when my best gunner totally misses the house sized tank 20 feet in from of him and gets me ranting and wanting an undo/redo/wtf button.  But that's part of luck and chance and it wouldn't be a real game without.  None of these things warrant losing even one star so my rating stands at 5 out of 5.<br /><br />All in all I think this is one of the most refined and polished games I've ever played.  It's done.  Totally complete and playable on initial download.  No waiting weeks or months for patches and updates.  No hours spent grinding through forums hoping to find a fix for some inane problem.  This game works and works well.<br /><br />When the next episode or book in the story is released for the PC I will most certainly buy it too.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars for this one and kudos for the developers.  Well Done!",

In fact, it's some of the worst I've ever seen.  They put almost no effort into it and the result is difficult, tedious and barely useable.  If you're very interested in programming macros, get a logitech.  I haven't tried the razor software so can't speak to it, but this software is much harder to program with than logitech's and even a bit worse than cooler master's.<br /><br />Example: The worst part of the software is once you have programmed in and edited your macro, you cannot save it.  It is forever bound to the key you selected.  If you decide you want it on a different key, you have to program it into that key.  With the logitech software, once you have created a macro you can drag and drop it whereever you want.<br /><br />So as not to be all about talking up logitech I will say physically I like this keyboard better than any logitech I've used.

                "text": "EDIT/UPDATE: This strap is still doing really well. Shortly after this review (Sep 2021), once I discovered Supernatural-Workout near, go far fitness app, I have been using it every single day for 60+ minutes at a time. I basically commandeered my husbands Oculus, and have been the only one using it. ZERO ISSUES. Now it is the end of December and I figured I would mention how well it has been holding up.<br /><br />This strap takes some pressure off my cheekbones. I could feel the difference right away. The head strap is  a significant upgrade over the default strap. My husband and I are currently sharing the Oculus, and we're always having to adjust the strap. I think my head it bigger. Adjusting this strap is as easy as a turn of a dial. SO MUCH BETTER, easier, more comfortable. We both are really liking this so far.<br /><br />The silicon face cover is much better than the one that ships with the Oculus Quest 2. It is more robust, and I can feel the difference both when holding one in each hand, and once on the VR-- it is just more comfortable. ALSO, it has more material in the nose bridge area, which helps to fill up any gaps. There is a slit in the longer material which allows it to comfortably fit around various noses. Before I could see the floor and outside light, now it is pretty much all gone.<br /><br />This strap simply feels more secure over the default. Everything about it more comfortable and natural feeling.<br /><br />As for the battery pack holder, we currently do not have a battery pack to use so I cant comment on how well it holds one. But I can say that it is similar to a phone holder-- uses tension to hold it in place. I dont notice any added weight, or at least nothing that makes it uncomfortable by the addition of a more robust head strap and battery pack holder.<br /><br />The cut out of material that leads toward rear of the strap is not perfect. I dont see it impacting anything unless it peels off. Hopefully all remains good there.<br /><br />I am really quite pleased SO FAR. You better believe I will be back to update immediately if I experience anything bad, but I will also update if I experience/notice anything else worth sharing.<br /><br />I hemmed and hawed between a 4 and 5. 4 only because I havent had this long, but 5 because if it continues to be a good working item then it is something I would easily recommend for someone to try. The current price of &lt;$40 (and now there is a coupon for a few bucks off), makes it competitively priced, and worth trying. Anyway, 5 it is!",

Anything could be inside.<br /><br />It fits my (well, my husbands Oculus Quest 2-- but I commandeered it for Supernatural) perfectly. Has plenty of room to store cord, extra face frames, the controllers, and my grips. The VR just nestles inside snug. Has added internal strap to secure the headset. And a mesh pocket for smaller accessories. Outer case is durable feeling, has a strap for use on luggage, a hand strap, and an optional long shoulder strap.<br /><br />Currently priced at $24.99. If they keep it at that price point, I would think this will garner more purchases over others I see. This is a perfectly good case, and if you like the clean, plain visual aspect of it, it is perfect (though I imagine the smooth surface could be dolled up with some stickers).<br /><br />The product description did an excellent job on describing this product and showing off what it looks like inside and out. The product is as expected. I dont need to stuff my Oculus in it as I pretty much use it at home every day a few times a day, but it is nice to have a secure spot for times when not in use, and of course for when I take it on the go.",

                "text": "It doubles play time without need for a physical battery pack. Nice option for those that use some apps laying down- there is no battery bracket to get in the way.<br /><br />The Oculus has about 2 hours of run time, or less. I use mine primarily for the workout/fitness app, \"Supernatural-workout near, go far\". At full charge, I will go 1.5 hours, with maybe 20 minutes left. Totally fine, so long as my Oculus is fully charged. If I want to do anything else, then I need to charge it. Or if anyone else wants to play. I have been meaning to buy a battery pack for my [[ASIN:B094Z85PXS X-super Home Adjustable Elite Strap with Battery Bracket]] but haven't done so yet, I have been just using it every single day as a regular strap. My husband bought me a battery pack but it is way too huge. So when this rechargeable strap came up as an option to try, I figured it was something worth checking out.<br /><br />The head strap is light and comfortable. The rear hugs the head, SO this is an excellent contender for those that play games, use apps that are conducive to relaxing, laying down.  The fit relies entirely on the velcro straps (top & sides). I prefer the additional crank turn knob of my other strap, but this style is pretty popular and must have merit. The battery charges pretty quick. It holds about 2 hours of charge. I dont plan to have it as my daily strap, at least right now. I think I will keep it charged up, and have it on stand by for times I either failed to fully charge my Oculus, or when someone wants to use it after me and needs the extra juice. Or for after my evening workout session, and I want to go lay on the couch comfortably.<br /><br />Anyway, so far so good. If I experience anything else worth sharing, I will be back to do so.",

                "text": "I have two complaints.<br /><br />Complaint #1<br />-----------------<br />They really leave you in the wind with this product. I figured it out, but I'm wondering about people who are not as resourceful. The description implies you just plug it into the Switch, and you start pairing. That is not the case, at least it's not the case for PS3 controllers. There are no instructions, so naturally, I went to 8bitdo's website. On their site, there is something called the PS3 PAIRING TOOL. Sounds like what I need, so I downloaded it. In the downloaded folder is a README file. How often do people read the README files? Luckily I did! It says that before I can launch the software, I need to install a program called the SixaxisPairToolSetup-0.3.0.exe, or I can \"Temporarily disable driver signature enforcement.\" For this 2nd option, there is a bunch of screenshots showing you how to do it in windows. I tried the 1st option first, and after installing the sixaxispairtool, it told me to restart. After restarting, normally a software will launch itself to help you along where you left off, but not this one. Once you restart, it was gone. LOL! So I thought maybe the magic has been done, so I proceeded to launch the PS3 pairing tool, but it didn't work. It would not recognize my ps3 controller. So I decided to try the second option, temporarily disable driver signature enforcement. For this option, I recommend you guys put all the instructional screenshots in your dropbox, then you can follow along reading the instructions from your phone. Because doing these steps will put you in a RECOVERY mode, so you can't view those screenshots anymore. They didn't make this accessory for everybody. They made it for techies and tinkerers who will go out of their way to make it work.<br /><br />Complaint #2<br />----------------<br />8bitdo isn't too good at adapter designs. Take their Gbros adapter for example. It doesn't fit wavebird receivers, not because it isn't compatible, but because of the design. So Retro Fighters basically just built a new shell for that receiver and fixed the issue. So it isn't too surprising to me that this wireless receiver is a bad design too. Why did they make the usb brick casing so fat? You have to imagine that many people have two ps3 or ps4 controllers, that they may want to buy 2 receivers like I did. Well, two receivers will not fit at the same time on the Dock side ports. If you want to use two, you'll have to use a USB A to A extender, or a hub. There is one more usb port in the back of the Dock between the HDMI and Power ports. Guess what, it won't fit there either. If I try to squeeze the brick in, it will lift the power and hdmi cables from their ports at an angle, and this can especially damage the power cable.<br /><br />I like to imagine this is what happened during product development...<br /><br />8bitdo: \"This is a beautiful design, and when our fans buy ONE receiver to add ONE PlayStation controller, they will be very happy.\"<br />Employee: \"Should we design it so TWO receivers will fit on the side ports? Maybe also make it fit on the 3rd port in the back? Also, we might want to add a step by step manual for ps3 controllers\"<br />8bitdo: \"What's your name? You are fired!\"",

Third party docking products on Amazon do not come with a power adapter, only USB cables. Which means they probably require you to have your PS3 on.  I've asked if Smartphone wall adapters will work with those third party docks, they say yes, but I don't trust the answer.  I kept searching and ran onto this official Playstation product. This is just what the doctor ordered! Actually, a computer will charge your ps3 controllers too, but I'd like all my game accessories in my media cabinet. This adapter tucks in the back of my cabinet and the ps3 controllers are now charging inside my cabinet out of sight, out of mind. $10 and it's an official item. Doesn't get any better!",

With the generic one, I see more wavy diagonal lines. With the MayFlash, the picture is smoother, the diagonal lines are gone. You need to go to your wii setting and set it to wide screen and 480p. You also need to go to your display source and set it to widescreen as well. Everything looks proportional, the image is not stretched. This is a keeper, the other one is being returned.<br /><br />BTW, I should mention that I'm using an ultra short throw projector with a 120\" screen. With such a big image, maybe it is easier for me to see imperfections. So that should tell you how good this adapter is. It got rid of the lines I was seeing with the generic version.

I have two kids now and the Wii is getting a new life. But I digress... about these guns. Three things I don't like....<br /><br />1. You're kinda inserting your wiimote in at an angle. You basically place your wiimote on top of the gun mold \"bed,\" but it cannot clear yet until you angle it and start to insert it into the connector. Then you can push it down flat. Connecting plugs and ports at an angle is uncomfortable to me. I feel eventually you will ruin the connector or port.<br /><br />2. So in most Wii shooting games, the B button is your trigger, it is the button on the back of the Wiimote. So all these gun accessories are built so that when you pull the trigger, the mechanism inside then clicks the B button.  So for a good gun accessory, the trigger on the gun mold should be as easy and as quick as clicking the B button on the Wiimote. Well, that's not the case with this gun, so you become a worse player. There is more resistance with the trigger, as well as more travel time. Travel time is how long it takes for you to completely pull the trigger. When you're just playing around with it and pulling the trigger. It's just like any other toy gun, you don't think anything about it. But when you start to play wii games, you will see that you got wore. Because all that extra time adds up.<br /><br />3. I wanted my kids to be able to use it, but the handle plus trigger width was just too wide for a 5 yr old's hands. She ended up using two hands and spent more time focusing on pressing the trigger than aiming.  So this is not good for little kids with small hands.<br /><br />For little kids with small hands, I recommend something called the \"Wii blasters.\" This was a set that came out around 2011. It comes with 2 guns and a game code for BIG TOWN SHOOT OUT. The game codes have since expired, but people are still selling these guns.",

If you want FULL body protection, these 2 piece hard shell cases are what you want. However, you should consider this \"con\" before making your decision... You see the Switch buttons and directional pad protrude above the surface only by a little, so by placing a case layer on top, it makes the buttons almost feel flush to the surface. It's not completely flush, they are still raised above the case, but barely. You will need to feel for yourself and decide if this is right for you. I still give the case 5 stars because it does the job, and includes 2 glass screen protectors and cute thumb grips. A lot of bang for your buck!",

In any case, the 8bitdo is a good alternative if you're not sold on this PDP. https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-SN30-Controller-Windows-macOS-Android/dp/B0748S1VDC/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=8bitdo+sn30+pro&qid=1604087284&sr=8-4<br /><br />This would be a 4 star controller, if not for the battery life, since it's price in the same ballpark as the 8bitdo SN30. But the fact that PDF is officially licensed and it has the battery advantage, then it brings it back to 5-Stars! You need to decide what's more important to you when deciding between these two controllers.",

                "text": "Of all the 3rd party joycons I've tried, this is probably my least favorite. What caught my eye was the charging cable. I thought it was pretty unique and unlike others. However, I don't think you can use it to charge other joycons. It was made specifically for theirs. I connected to another brand of joycons and there doesn't seem to be any reaction. I will update this review if I discover anything new on this front.<br /><br />So there are two main things why this has been my least favorite:<br /><br />1. Weight... At 1.7 oz. each, this is the lightest third party joycon I have. It is cheap! The original is 2.5 oz. each.<br />2. No SL/SR top covers. So if you split these up to play multiplayer games, your SL/SR buttons will be hard to press.<br /><br />I'll rate this 3 stars. For 3rd party, I prefer this set a review a while ago. It is 2 oz. each and they include the SL/SR top covers.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UHC1PVPNANJ3/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HQX1HKM",

For the serious gamers out there. The good news is that all the parts seem to be Sanwa compatible from the joystick to the buttons. So if you want to, you can replace the components. An 8 yr old doesn't know how to complain about a missed combo. LOL! So, I won't be doing any modification. This stick is fine as is. The red top of this stick is not permanent, it is a decorative plate, and can be replaced with other plates. They do include an extra design for you, but we happen to love red, so we won't be changing anything. Another thing to note is that when you plug in the USB-C cable, it is simply for power for wired play. It doesn't do any charging because there is no internal rechargeable battery. If you want to play wireless, you need to use two AA batteries, which they claim can give you 30 hrs of gameplay. We'll see about that. This is a 5-Star product!",

The design on this one seems pretty open, look at the pictures, you'll see the width is wide. So I had hopes this could be the one! My switch with the thin case sat on the dock with no issues at all. That's what I was hoping for based on the design. But I realized of a new issue. Even if you can seat your Switch with a case, it might not charge. The reason is because your case creates a rise that prevents the usb-c port and plug to fully connect. Logically, I knew about this already. But I anticipated that the contact would be enough for it to charge. Sadly, the answer is no. It needs to be 100% docked. The only solution is to modify the case, like cutting out a slot to allow it to fully seat with no rise. This isn't something I'm going to subtract a star for. The dock does it's job perfectly fine when I take my switch out of the case. But just a FYI to those who are trying to do what I'm doing. This is still a 5-Stars product!",

You actually have to flip the console upside down. So the PS5 logo is facing the ground. This is a little concerning to me.

If you don't have high speed internet don't bother buying the collector's edition because the extra costumes have to be downloaded from online.  We have internet (obviously) but live in a rural area and do not have high speed internet and therefore unable to get the costumes - my husband just contacted the company and got a big fat 'too bad!'.<br /><br />The bookends are cute and Cody's given them a place of honor holding his other Little Big Planet games.  The stuffed character is okay but nothing to get too excited over but otherwise there's nothing to really recommend this package and certainly no reason to pay extra for it.<br /><br />Honestly, my son loved the Little Big Planet games from the very beginning and I was so excited to get him this set but felt very let down by the whole 'downloadable costume' thing.  For the price we paid they should have had the costumes on a separate disc or even had the game disk already contain the costumes.  At the very least there should be another option for us poor shmucks who live in the middle of nowhere and don't have an option of high speed internet.",

                "text": "When I got these headphones I thought it would be a great way to avoid having to listen to whatever gaming system my son was playing on the television.  Unfortunately do they not only drown out his yelling at the TV, but they also don't quiet the gaming noise either (I thought all you had to do was plug the device into the proper slot on the HD TV and instant silence, not so).  Instead, my husband and son sat there for an hour going through the various ways to turn off the sound on the television and finally found some button on the remote that mutes it.  However, if they forget to undo it when they're done then I'm stuck with a mute television and no clue how to fix it. LOL  I don't know how it would work with any other kind of TV.  We have a Vizio (if anybody has figured out how to get the headphones to work without all the drama please let me know!)<br /><br />Now, that being said, the headphones work beautifully for the computer, iPad, and iPhone and the sound is awesome.  I really love how big the earcovers are as well.  I wear glasses so my ear isn't being pressed down onto the frame (which hurts after awhile).  The glow from the headset is very cool even though you can't see it when you're wearing them but still... it makes a useful device neat to look at :)  The headphones are on the large size so any visions I had of packing them to the local library for a few hours of mindless internet usage using them is out (the black piece you see in the picture sits on the top of your head - everything above that is actually way above it if that gives you any idea of how large these are.<br /><br />When I asked my son if he had anything to add, he said the microphone could be a little longer.  Apparently it only extends to the side of his face and he'd prefer it be closer to his mouth.  Otherwise he loves this headset.  It makes it much easier for him to sneak internet gaming time.",

If you're offended by violence, cursing, or a complete disregard for offending anyone than I'd suggest you steer clear of this title.  For the rest of you, grab a copy and immerse yourself in hilarity.  I'm sure someone else covered the intricate details of the story so I'm not going to bother going there, but I do have to tell you I really enjoyed the way the game makers stayed true to the cartoonish appearance of the characters and scenes.  There's no attempt at making them look 'real' or make the graphics more dramatic.  It's the simplicity of this game that makes this game fun.<br /><br />Admittedly I do allow my son (now 17) to play games such as Halo, Left for Dead an Skyrim so the rating didn't faze me.  What did surprise me was his reaction when I told him I'd nabbed a copy with the Amazon Vine program.  He thought I'd lost my mind and actually said &#34;um, mom you do know that show has a lot of cursing and violence.&#34;  I said, &#34;yeah, but it looks like it would be fun&#34; and to his surprise, it is... one of his favorite parts so far is right at the beginning when you select your player name.

He did mention that the police are very persistent BUT they don't have boats which he mentions is kind of stupid since it limits the ways they can catch you. (of course this he says is a negative but then complains because the police never give up.)<br />I do have to mention that he hasn't played this game even once since he's beat it and normally he does play games over and over so I'm not sure it's worth buying brand new.",

I purchased the digital download because I could not wait to go buy the CD at a store. The YouTube videos cracked me up!<br /><br />The 13 gig download took about 2 hours on my 20 meg cable connection. After it self extracted, it launched the installer. Installation was a breeze and went off without a hook. I launched the game and Games for Windows Live automatically updated and patched it without any issues. The graphics were nice on default but I wanted to set everything to max. Went to options and maxed out the video settings (GeForce GTX 580). When I clicked apply, the game kicked me to the desktop and then I got worried because of all the negative reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Since I am running Windows 7 64 bit edition, I went in and set the game to run as administrator. It started flawlessly and to my surprise, had applied and saved my video settings. I started a new game and it has performed remarkably and without error or flaw! I am getting excellent frame rates and not so much as a hiccup.<br /><br />I have nothing but high praise for this game and I am very glad I got it!<br /><br />Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz (8 CPUs), ~3.4GHz<br /><br />Viper 12288MB RAM<br /><br />GeForce GTX 580",

This is nothing like SimCity and more like outpost, outpost 2 or other similar games. Very unhappy with the result based on other reviews. The graphics are not all that great in reality.<br /><br />This game has the absolute largest agenda I have ever seen in any game or even movie. Normally I don't care because I look at games and movies as entertainment but this one is extremely obvious and in your face. First off, your faced with a choice to go with the green movement or with the alternative, who, are surely made into the \"bad\" guys because they use oil and coal among other things. I must say it's pretty true to character from what I have seen thus far(except the \"conservatives\" (ie: those who don't care about the green movement), who are made to be the bane and evil of society), even the environmentalist guys who are portrayed in such a good light are classic 60's Woodstock hippies.<br /><br />All things aside, for entertainment value it is just okay if you can use your sensibility and common sense. Seems to have a decent and in depth story line if you can get over the socialist, geo-engineering, uber left and one world crap that is totally embedded within! No joke! If you have kids and want to help prevent them from being indoctrinated into the lie, keep them away from this game at all costs. I know many people will think my review is crazy but they are in denial. If you are conservative then you will understand this review with total clarity.<br /><br />At the very least I am happy to have purchased this so I can warn people off. This is a sure method the green movement is using to try and sway younger peoples viewpoints and ultimately change this country and world into what they want.",

                "text": "Ok first off, I had the Rift before this S model, so this is somewhat of a comparison.<br /><br />The Rift S is definitely more comfortable than it's predecessor. The foam is soft and it seems a tad lighter. I wear glasses, and the S does not rest on them as much as the last generation, which is good. I can spend much more time using the Rift S because it's comfort is that much better. The S also slips on and off my face a lot easier than the last generation and I have a large head, being 6'5\" @ 275lbs.<br /><br />It is great that it does not use external sensors to track movement, because it is just far less cumbersome and more of a simple plug and play device now. I have an Acer Predator 17, which has a display port, but the Rift S does come with an adapter if yours does not.<br /><br />The controllers are the same size and weight, which is really good. They are far less bulky than it's competitors, which makes using the VR much more enjoyable in my opinion.<br /><br />Headset tracking of itself is flawless, it is right on when you move your head around. However, I do get headset out of bounds type messages just looking around sometimes and that is annoying.<br /><br />Eye relief, I don't really know about. I've adjusted it to max (72) and least and noticed zero difference in anything.<br /><br />The bad news.<br /><br />External tracking of the controllers is glitchy and glitchy a lot. You no longer have a fine tracking experience that is so smooth, as it was in the previous Rift. Your hands in the VR like to twitch, jump and sometimes freeze. It's not 100% of the time that it does this, but it happens frequently enough to be bothersome. The rest of the time it is smooth and responsive.<br /><br />Optics. This is where the Rift S falls even shorter, in my experience. For starters, your field of view has reduced and it is not quite as immersive as the previous Rift. For example, it is as though you are looking through toilet paper tubes now, as there are large black areas of nothing surrounding the visual field. Tunnel vision.  Although the experience is still fun, I am very disappointed in this, as it has lost some of it's VR experience as a result.<br /><br />The resolution is supposed to be higher, but I do not see that at all. Fonts are still grainy and it is too similar to the last Rift to say that there is much, if any improvement in resolution.<br /><br />The screen brightness is less in the Rift S, so it loses points for that. Although still pretty vibrant, it's just lacking something I can't exactly put my finger on.<br /><br />Overall, it is a step back from the Rift in the critical areas a VR should be and a step forward in comfort and convenience. It all depends on what is more important to you.",

                "text": "RedThunder One-Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a functional half keyboard with mechanical keys. The only issue I ran into during my use of this item was that once the re-bindable macro keys were altered, I was unable to revert them into the original \"F\" keys they began. The instructions were difficult to fully understand. I am uncertain if it was due to translation difficulties or a lack of space on the small pamphlet.<br /><br />RedThunder One-Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard allowed me to conserve space on my desk. The keyboard is a good starting point for any gamer interested in an mechanical keyboard that does not want to commit to the higher price for a full keyboard.<br /><br />With small rubber-like feet to help keep it in place and the light weight design the product can help on-the-go laptop users. The keyboard had built in anti-ghosting, so you would not drop keys when pressing multiples at the same time. This will allow more hectic game-play without dropped inputs. The half of the keyboard you get with this covers most basic PC games (most First person shooters), but may leave you lacking for games which expect a full range (such as Smite or a multitude of strategy games).<br /><br />A small card that came with the keyboard from the creator pressing for those with issues to reach out to the makers and those with positive opinions to share their opinion. The website advertised by the production company was mostly not useful as I was unable to find anything of great use and there was a number of translation errors on the physical box [example: \"Fast eating chicken stability with many key no conflict reaction\"].<br /><br />Overall, I find RedThunder One-Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a good product. It's ideal for someone who is looking to reduce their wear and tear on a laptop, shared keyboard, an addition to their portable/space sensitive options, or anyone wanting to dip their toes into a mechanical keyboard.<br /><br />Of note: the box does not mention support for windows 10. They keys are click-y and the extra volume can be jarring for those whom live in close quarters.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope you have found it helpful and informative.",

I'm going to go back and play them all over again so I can enjoy the Easter Eggs again that one of my sequel games requires some saves from the previous released game to access.

It has challenging puzzles and the gameplay mechanics are easy to master. I'm not a huge fan of 1st person style gameplay, but it worked well in this game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Since you play as one type of character (mage, warrior, assassin, etc...) you can play the game more than once using a different skill set each time. You can also choose whether to be evil or good, which will change the story as well. If you like Oblivion, Dragon Age or The Witcher, I think you will really enjoy this game as well.

The sound quality of the mic isn't as good as the stereo headset. My chat friends notice a difference when I switch and say they can't hear me as well with this one.The other problem is the cord.  I've owned this headset for less than 3 months, and the cord has frayed and is breaking at the base of the connector to the controller. Where the plug-in becomes wire gets pinched against me when I hold it. It can't be avoided, therefore it is breaking. I wish the connector was a 90 degree plug-in that I've seen on other headsets. Those seem to hold up better.",

One of the most glaring problems is the ear covers. They are just too small...and round. How many people do you know with ROUND ears? Most ears are oval in shape. I think my ears are pretty normal size, but they don't quite fit in the ear cushions. It is very uncomfortable.<br /><br />I tried using the headset with my xBox One in a chat group with my friends. At one point they were having trouble hearing me. There are only two sound controls, the mute switch (which works fine), and a volume control. I thought the volume control was to control the level of sound I was hearing in the earphones. Apparently, it controls my voice to the group, because my friends were having trouble hearing me until I tinkered with the volume control. When I turned it up, they could hear me better. That was a little confusing.<br /><br />In the end, I took this headset off and went back to using my Turtle Beach headset. I don't recommend this headset.",

In game, it gives you the feeling of being on a floating, with no connection to the landscape or spaces. I played Skyrim on it. If I swung around to smack a sabre cat that was attaching me, I would way overswing. Aiming with a bow was nearly impossible. I put this away after just a little while. I couldn't handle it.

They don't put pressure on your ears or head. The ear cushions are exquisite. So comfortable.<br /><br />The sound quality is really good. While playing Valheim, I could easily detect the direction where the cackling Fulings are hiding in the brush, or when a Draugr is trying to sneak up behind me. I really appreciate that level of sensitivity in headphones.<br /><br />I don't have a cellphone, so I can't speak about the Bluetooth functions. I will say though , that some of the technical mechanics of the headphones were a little hard for me to figure out. The instruction manual wasn't much help. I am a technical dummy. My level of technical expertise is basically, find the button, push it, and I expect it to work. If it doesn't work, I will get immensely frustrated. I found myself getting very frustrated trying to get my headphones to work. I thought I was following instructions, but it just wasn't working. I enlisted my husband to help me. He got it working and it turned out to be something really simple...the USB cord for plugging the headset into my laptop wasn't plugged in all the way into the headset. I didn't realize that I needed to push so hard to get it to click into place. One of the things that confused me, is that the cord has a control on it, for sound. The control has no marks on it. There were 3 buttons and I couldn't figure out what all of them were for. The long was was a volume control. I got that one. I still don't understand what the other two buttons are for. It would have been nice if this was explained better in the manual, and if they were actually visibly marked with clear, understandable icons.<br /><br />Basically, these are really great headphones. I just think that the company is trying to hard to look cool at the expense of functionality and customer accessability. Perhaps the company feels that it's customer base are savvy techies that would appreciate the level of coolness that they are trying to achieve, but that leaves us normals frustrated and struggling to understand how to use their product. If the company reads this review...fyi. Normals like great sounding gaming too. Make these easier to use.",

                "text": "I didn't know what to expect from this product as I have never owned a pair of gaming headsets, but I wasn't willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a pair of headsets that may or may not enhance my experience.<br /><br />So let me break down the description given:<br />-- 7.1 surround - I've always see this more as a gimmick than an actual feature, even in headphones that cost hundreds of dollars but don't have discreet speakers.  The computer sees these headsets as stereo and not 7.1 so whatever program you run, whether it's a trailer with Dolby Atmos or a game, the output will still be stereo.  While their program supposedly tries to simulate virtual surround, you would still need the source to be 7.1 discreet channels so that their driver can process the signal to simulate surround sound.  These headsets do not have DTS-HD or Dolby ATMOS certification so they aren't actually able to process raw 7.1 channel data.  It means that in the end, the video player is still just playing stereo sound.  The end effect of turning on virtual 7.1 surround sound is that the soundtrack is more \"atmospheric\" or \"wider\" sounding, but you wouldn't be able to tell that a sound is coming from your rear left flank.  Since I never expected much out of this feature, I didn't mind that it wasn't true 7.1<br /><br />-- USB - True plug and play on Windows 10.  I plugged these headphones in and immediately, Windows output sound through them.  No muss no fuss.  It just worked.  You can install their driver, which turns on the \"virtual 7.1\" feature but that's pretty much like installing drivers for any realtek sound card.  You just have access to a few extra DSP effects.  Honestly, I don't like extra processing to my audio signals.  Being USB, it is a completely digital signal to your headphones all the way up until the speakers themselves.  On 3.5mm headphones, the audio signal is analog at 3.5mm port, at which point, you will get some signal degradation just from the connection itself.<br /><br />-- Gaming Headset with Microphone - I don't really play games online so I can't tell you whether the microphone is better or worse than any other headset but I can tell you that I used the Spirit Wolf with a few games and I was hearing sounds that I didn't hear in my Sennheisers.<br /><br />-- PC Gamers - BONUS!  This headset isn't just for PC gaming, it works with the Nintendo switch, too, using the USB port on the dock.  Even the volume buttons on the headset works!<br /><br />My overall experience with Spirit Wolf has been positive.  The sound is crisp and clear and the high frequencies are very good but the bass could have been better.  I'm not big on turning up the bass so it's not a big loss.  I still feel that the overall sound quality is very good.<br /><br />The headset is circumaural which means it surrounds your ears and the speakers are not pressed right against your head.  It means that noise isolation isn't as good as earbuds or even supra-aural headphones (which press up against your ear), but there's a reason professional gaming headphones are this style.  You can wear them for longer periods without discomfort and you are able to achieve a wider sound.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this headset for its price and overall sound quality.  The ability to use it with my Switch is just bonus.<br /><br />EDIT:  I must amend my previous conclusions regarding the virtual surround sound.  I recently started playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider and as a test, I went into the audio settings for the game.  The options were stereo, 5.1, 7.1, and spatial sound.  Reading the description for spatial sound, it states that it is meant to be used with Windows Spatial Sound (right click on the speaker icon in your system tray and you'll see an option to turn it on).  Well, I tried the spatial sound in three different ways: with only the in-game spatial sound setting on,  the in-game setting + Windows Spatial Sound on, and in-game setting + XEar driver 7.1 on.  All three give slightly different positional sound effects but I found that the XEar effect was the best.  The sounds simulate a wide environment and I was able to distinguish the direction of each distinct sound source.  Very impressive.",

Most manufacturers mold textures into the plastic to give them grip.  My past experience with satin surfaces is that after a few years, they become a sticky mess.<br />-- Perhaps it is the product that I got but I charged the grip overnight without the joycons inserted and the red charging light was still on when I checked on it in the morning so there is no indication that the charging has completed.  This might mean that there is no cut-off for when the battery is fully charged.<br />-- The joy-cons fit too snugly.  It is actually a little difficult to slide the controllers in and out of the grip.  This could be because of the satin finish that is sprayed on to the underlying plastic.<br /><br />Other features:<br />-- Charges the joycons with the built-in battery pack.  A blue light indicates that the controllers are charging.<br />-- Not much heavier than the original switch grip.<br />-- Wider than the original grip.  For me, this is actually more comfortable.<br /><br />Again, this will meet my requirements but I wonder how long the internal battery pack will last if there is no charging cut-off.",

This wasn't limited to just the Switch, but cell phones and laptops were suffering the same issue.  At this point, news of those issues have generally subsided.  Power adaptor designers have taken safety more seriously and personally, I have been able to use multiple docks and hubs with the Switch with no issues.  In short, this KIWIHOME Switch Dock did not blow up my switch.<br /><br />This KIWIHOME USB C Charger is a very compact dock for the Switch.  When travelling, it is usually necessary to pack the official Nintendo Switch charger for power.  This third-party charger is no bigger than the OEM charger but has the additional advantage of a detachable charging cable, which means it is even easier to pack.<br /><br />Of course, the best feature of this charger is the ability to act as a dock.  In a normal case, one must add the large Switch dock in addition to an HDMI cable in order to play in docked mode while on travel.  This charger allows one to leave the large dock at home.  It is an elegant solution.<br /><br />While on the topic of travel, this charger is rated for 110-220v.  This means that with the addition of a plug adapter, this charger will work in Europe as well as the US and around the world.<br /><br />An issue that one may face due to the design of this product is that the television may not be close enough to an open power socket.  This would need to be solved either with a long HDMI cable or an extension cord.",

The headphones cover the ear and not on them.  It also sports a suspension style headband.  I'm not a streamer but this headset would not be out of place on a twitch streamer's head, in my opinion.<br /><br />The most important feature for me when it comes to the G733 is the wireless feature and the sound quality.  The sound is clear and crisp with a good range, but not a booming bass (which I don't mind.  I would have turned that down anyway).  When I put on the headset and launched Biomutant, I noticed that the sound was very close, almost like in a sound booth.  Compared to my wired headset, the SADES Spirit Wolf, the sound profile of the Logitech G733 is much smaller as opposed to the large hall feel of the SADES.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the large, open feel of the SADES to the smaller close-up feel of the Logitech.  It makes games feel bigger and more intense.<br /><br />Initially, I wanted to give this product 3 stars but I realized that perhaps my complaint is a personal preference and Logitech couldn't be blamed for it.  This is a good product that works well, but personally, I wouldn't feel that it justifies its price when compared to the sound quality of a sub-30-dollar usb headset.",

                "text": "I went through a bit of flip-flopping with the Eyglo 5 in 1 Accessories Case for Oculus Quest 2.  When I saw the listing for this product, I thought that it was a great set that included everything I needed for the Quest 2, although from the pictures, I did note that the hand strap seemed flimsy.<br /><br />When I received it, I found that the head strap was made of stiffer plastic than the original straps so it was very difficult to install.  I was still worried about the click-in button at the top of the hand strap and the fact that it was so narrow.  I expected that any swinging of the controller could slip the strap off.  The silicone eye piece fit well, but at first, it gave me a fright because when pressed against the head, the cover would flare out and obstruct the sensor that Oculus proximity sensor, making it think that the headset turn off because it didn't detect a face.  I thought my Oculus was broken!  Lastly, I found that the controllers were hard to fit into the case (They needed to be looped through each other just so) and even then, the case didn't close without the back piece of the headset pushing against the top, creating a slight bulge.  I found that this was a case of \"looks good on paper\" but not great in actuality.<br /><br />Because of all of these problems, I was going to give this product 3 stars, but after spending some time with it, I found that I didn't mind any of those shortcomings.  The head strap is much more comfortable and secure than the original oculus.  The eye piece is MUCH better than the original cloth as sweat is easily wiped off (Facebook is currently addressing this issue and the Oculus will now come with silicone eye pieces).  The hand straps turned out to work well enough.  I don't worry about losing the controllers because I find that I don't have a tendency to flick the controller with my hand completely open.  Lastly, I find that I don't need to use the case when I'm at home so I will only face the awkwardness of putting in the goggles when I intend on taking it on travel.<br /><br />In the end, I got a complete set of accessories all in one package and they do work.  I'm much happier having this set than not.  The out-of-the box experience with the Oculus leaves much to be desired and accessories are just a fact of life.  Just as purchasing a case for a phone or tablet is just part of the cost of the device.",

Both of these things are accessories that every Quest 2 must get and there are many options available to fit the bill.<br /><br />Out of the box, the Quest 2 comes with elastic straps that just aren't enough to hold the VR Goggles in place very well.  When turning your head, the goggle tends to swing around and feel like they will fall off.  Also, if you're one of the early adopters that purchased the Quest 2 before Facebook issued their recall where they will send you a silicone cover for the goggles, you're stuck with a cloth face cover that lets too much light through and gets pretty disgusting after just a short time using the goggle due to sweat.<br /><br />So the X-Super Home head strap features a battery holder at the back of the head, the theory being that the extra weight of the battery will help to counter balance the weight of the goggles, reducing neck strain while extending the play time of the goggles.  In practice, the battery makes the entire setup too heavy and reintroduces the problem of the goggles swinging around when turning your head.  In addition, there was a design error on the attachment bracket where the slot is shorter than the tab so the battery holder never fully slides into place.<br /><br />Due to the placement of the battery, the tightening knob is offset to the right of the battery.  This offset design creates a problem with the tightening system where one side would tighten more than the other, giving an unbalanced feel to the strap.<br /><br />The silicone cover, on the other hand, is quite excellent.  It has a texture on it that helps to keep a good grip around the eyes even when you sweat and the flaps over the bridge of the nose is larger than many others out there.  While not perfect, it greatly reducing the amount of light that leaks in.  Compare this to the silicone cover that Facebook sent as part of their recall, the Facebook cover is smooth and doesn't have a flap at all to cover the bridge of the nose.  The X-super Home cover is much better.<br /><br />So a less-than-ideal head strap and a great silicone cover.  Unfortunately, this doesn't justify the price of this product.",

They add more surface area to the controller than the ones that come from Nintendo, making it more comfortable to hold for people with larger hands.  They click in well adn fit the controllers perfectly.  When connected to the controller, the switch will show that the controllers are being charged, verifying that the batteries are indeed doing their job.<br /><br />The only problem I have found is that these grips will lose charge over the course of a few days if connected to the controllers.  This is because the controllers will trickle charge even when they are off.  This is quite a waste and it is better to remove the controllers when not in use.",

The only problem is that the docks are made for the controllers without the silicone sleeves that people usually put on their controllers.  In fact, there aren't many solutions out there that allow charging while using the silicone sleeves.<br /><br />With this All-in-One Magnetic Charging Kit for Oculus Quest 2, I'm able to resolve all of my problems.  This system is well thought out.  It comes with two rechargeable batteries and special battery covers that expose a magnetic charging port on the side of the controller.  It also comes with a magnetic type-c connector for your goggles.<br /><br />By cutting a small hole in the silicone sleeve, I'm able to charge the controllers without removing the sleeve and the cables are easy to connect because of the magnetic connectors.  The goggle is just as easy to charge with its corresponding magnetic connector.<br /><br />There are two problems with this system that you need to be aware of, though.  The first is that the type-c connector is not very strong.  It means that when pulling off the charging cable, the type-c plug with come with it.  The second problem is that the three devices will be sharing a single cable and thus, sharing the available amps.  The charging speed will suffer as a result.<br /><br />Overall, not having to go through the hassle of removing the silicone sleeve to change batteries makes this kit worth the purchase.  I don't have long play sessions with the VR system so I'm not so worried about charging speed.",

It is a fairly compact controller that is noticeably smaller than the Switch Pro controller.  It is actually well-built and has a great texture.  The entire controller feels soft and satin with nice analog sticks that don't feel loose.  The buttons feel good and the digital pad is fairly standard.<br /><br />Outside of these basic features, the controller has two programmable buttons in the back and turbo mode for all of the face and shoulder buttons.  The programmable buttons actually can remember fairly long sequences of button presses and digital pad inputs.  I used it to go through some particularly annoying menus in Xenoblade 3 that I needed to do over and over again (collectopedia).  I programmed a series of presses, holds and wait times that allowed me to go through the menu 5 times with each press of the programmable button.<br /><br />What's more, the vibration strength is programmable, the face plate is easily removeable (although I haven't seen replacement faceplates available) and even Amiibo support is built in.  It really is a good value for the price.  Aside from the smaller size, this is a great replacement for the Pro controller.<br /><br />On the PC, this is a great bluetooth controller that can operate in Xinput mode for maximum game compatibility.  This feature is something you don't find in many other third party controllers out there.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this controller is the fact that the ZL and ZR triggers are digital only.  When using this controller on the PC, you really need to have analog triggers to get the most out of many games.<br /><br />In the end, this product is geared toward the Switch and has the added option to be used on the PC and mobile phones but without analog triggers, it really is only good on the Switch.",

                "text": "[[VIDEOID:bcce61b61b8337c3b68e072c0d20d249]] I had a USB gaming headset that worked fairly well.  It had large speakers that gave the sound a \"roomy\" feeling, especially when paired with the driver software that it came with, but the wire was driving me crazy.  I couldn't step away from my desk without removing a few things or I'd end up pulling away my computer with me.<br /><br />So, I was in the market for a nice pair of wireless gaming headsets.  I've come across many in the 30-dollar range but none of the descriptions for those touted surround sound.  Eventually, I had to look in the 60 - 90 range.<br /><br />This pair of OCG Gaming Headsets 2.4GHz Bluetooth Wireless Gaming Headphones were just what I needed.  I wanted bluetooth capabilities because I wanted to have it as an option in case I wanted to pair it to two computers (one via dongle and one via bluetooth).  I also wanted the option of using it with other gaming systems such as an XBox or Playstation.  The usb dongle gives that versatility.<br /><br />I really don't care much for RGB as they just make my computers distracting and I'm not a game streamer or youtuber (not yet, anyway, ha ha), but if you do like them, this headset has them...<br /><br />So, what do I think?  I'd been playing Uncharted 4 on my PC with my old pair of headphones and it sounded great.  The surround didn't really seem like it worked very well.  After I received the OCG, I plugged in the USB dongle and booted up the game.  The game automatically detected the headset and showed that it was using virtual surround.  Immediately, I found that I was hearing sounds that I hadn't heard before!<br /><br />As the character walked around, I heard the jangling sounds of the equipment he had at his belt, I heard the companion character talking behind me and as I turned, her voice moved around my head.  I was super impressed!<br /><br />I then disconnected the dongle and tried the headset in bluetooth mode.  The sound was a little muffled and there was almost no surround effect, even though the game still said that it was doing virtual surround.<br /><br />So I'm definitely using the dongle for all my gaming.  I love this thing!",

Eventually, the rubber actually rubbed off.  Add to that, the right stick began to stick a little for some reason.<br /><br />I knew it was time to attempt a repair.  While doing so, I thought I'd pick interesting colors for the analog sticks to make it fun.  I bought the TOMSIN Replacement Joysticks for Xbox One Series X/S Controller in the Nintendo Switch blue/red combo.<br /><br />The installation was straightforward.  Just followed a teardown video on youtube and used the included tools.  The tools came in handy to pry the plastic open and unscrew the screws holding the controller together.<br /><br />Replacement was simple.  Just pull off the old analog sticks and pop in the new ones.  They fit perfectly and now, I have a controller that feels new and responsive.  Great product.",

                "text": "Many Nintendo Switch cases have hit the market since the release of the versatile gaming system and this this one meets all of the critical criteria of a good case but falls a bit short in order to be considered great.<br /><br />The Switch fits perfectly in the top with adequate padding to protect the critical top glass LED screen. The 2 Joy-Con controllers fit snugly into individual slots beneath the main unit and there is another secure area to store the power adapter (and a few games) which is a huge plus for this case - which many other cases neglect.<br /><br />As I stated, for travel purposes, this case is excellent.<br /><br />While this case advertises itself as one where you can “charge and play” - that is awkward at best.  First the Joy-Cons do not comfortably fit on the primary unit while in the case.  If too much pressure is applied to the screen while propped on the stand it moves too much for accurate game play.<br /><br />I have to give this case 3 STARS - it will definitely protect your Nintendo Switch and all of its necessary accessories when traveling better than many other cases but it won’t be staying in the case as you play...<br /><br />UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Now that my son has had more time using this case he has told me that he liked it much more than he initially did.<br /><br />Since I do not actually use the Switch I had to write my review based on his impressions and as he has used it he has liked it more and more.  Often when the Nintendo Switch is played in handheld mode the joycons are held separately from the central screen unit so the fact that they don’t fit on it in the case does not matter.<br /><br />In his opinion this is the best case he has used for his Nintendo Switch and we would definitely recommend it as a great way to protect your investment.",

I never realized there was such a vast difference in quality between keyboards until I began working on this one.  This keyboard can actually help you be more productive and make less errors when typing.<br /><br />Aesthetically this keyboard is super cool. It allows for the colors of the keys to be changed in all sorts of patterns and designs to suit your particular tastes. In addition there are LED light strips on both sides that can be adjusted.<br /><br />This is an all around incredible keyboard that is a joy to work on.",

This mouse makes use of the latest Bluetooth 5.0 technology making connections dependable and consistent.  While having a steady connection is critical for a reliable mouse that is only one of the factors that makes this mouse excellent.<br /><br />There is no adding batteries to this wireless mouse.  While most similar products mean replacing batteries and locating a new one when the old dies- this one has a powerful battery built within it.  All that is required is plugging the mouse into a USB port - and it can be used while the battery is charging!  The mouse sleeps when not in use preserving the battery and reawakens immediately, in addition there is a power switch for when work is completed.  The battery lasts far longer than I anticipated - I plug mine in to charge once a week to 10 days and I’ve never had mine die.<br /><br />There are 3 DPI settings which control how sensitive the mouse is or how many dots per inch it detects. This mouse is every bit as accurate as my wired mice but doesn’t have the restrictions that come from being tethered.<br /><br />This mouse has built in LED lights that “breathe” - slowly illuminating and dimming.  It looks great whether you game or not.<br /><br />In terms of how it fits in the hand - I love the ergonomics of this mouse.  I have found this mouse fits perfectly within my palm without over extension of my wrist.  It’s comfortable to use all day without having hand or wrist fatigue late in the day.<br /><br />This is an excellent, highly responsive, well made mouse.  It utilizes the latest technology for outstanding performance and durability.  This is an excellent product that I definitely recommend.",

I thought this would be a nice addition although it was simply too big.<br /><br />While based on the dimensions it should have worked, due to my swiveling desktop being made up of 2 surfaces, one for the keyboard and the other for the mouse, there was no way to have this lay flat across both.

I use it from bed to play games and media and don’t have to worry about that.<br /><br />As far as people reporting that it looks blurry well that’s not caused by the headset, it maybe be a fact that some people may have myopia (nearsighted) and never new about it. I have myopia so if I used this device without my glasses in then it will obviously look blurry. So when I put on my glasses it’s perfect.<br /><br />My wife on the other hand does not have nearsightedness so when she uses them she says it’s razor sharp even more so than our large screen tv she says. Tidbit all VR are designed to have the sharpest part of the image towards the center as that’s how human vision works we see in a 120 degrees arc. But most of that arc is peripheral vision so most of what we can see in total focus is towards the center of our vision, same goes for VR.<br /><br />Anyway with this I enjoy best of both worlds wired, and wireless with my other devices.<br />I also plan to get Oculus Quest, but this psvr can handle full featured games and not just VR experiences.<br /><br />I can’t help it, I’ll review the psvr in two parts.<br />Okay 1st part and at a later time I’ll review the vr experience as I got the headset ahead of my ps4 arrival.<br /><br />Okay let me make this clear, as of now I’m using the psvr on my Xbox One as a monitor for media and Xbox one games<br />until I get my PS4.<br /><br />I own both the Samsung VR and Oculus Go and can assure you even with my myopic eyes I can see that this looks far better than either the Samsung Vr or Oculus Go without a shadow of doubt! And I don’t have to worry about the other headsets having to charge batteries ever again!<br /><br />Let me tell you something...<br />I would get this just for media use alone for fact!!<br />Okay now the comfort of this device can’t be matched, it’s so darn comfortable comparing to my other devices,<br />I’m shocked how comfortable it is!

Now then it’s obvious that you should use this when your headset is not in use and your headset is powered off. Not good to use in standby mode because it will trick the unit to believe it’s still on your head going out of sleep mode and drain your battery. So use this when your totally done playing or when charging it to protect the lenses. Otherwise turn it off and then put the protector on the lens. Also good if you need to quickly put down the headset you can  put the protector in the headset briefly to go afk and have your lenses protected. But don’t leave it for long because the headset will go out of standby mode. As I said to store your headset turn it off then put in the protector. Great to keep your lenses safe from scratching or to keep other object from knocking against or coming into contact with the lenses ruining them.",

                "text": "Very rare 5 star review<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After 3 months of use (soild use, everyday).<br />This has been the BEST controller I've ever bought from ANY system in my 30 years of gaming.  The battery still last 40+hrs, and only takes 2 hrs or so to recharge.  Its durable as hell and holds up great. Buttons and stick still works like perfect.  And I have used it for 100s of hours since purchase.  A mist have even for the money wont.buy anything but from now on.<br /><br />( I've said that 3 times today but man, I've bought some good stuff)<br /><br />my 1st pro controller was the 30$ version amazon offers here n now.  I wore it out very quickly once I started playing fortnite.<br />You get what you pay for.  This controller is FKIN amazing..  the smoothness the control and feel of buttons and the controller itself.in your hands is like holding liquid gold.  I absolutely must insist that you spend the money and get this pro controller. It will make you a pro all the way around.<br /><br />Must have for all gaming shooters will see a huge difference between brands. Promise<br /><br />I will update as needed to see how long the controller will last. I see alot of review complaining about left stick after a short time...  I will let you know as it happens and my.use will not be lite.",

The characters are really well developed and look much more realistic than in previous games. I love the world that was created in this game.

This game is such an adventure that you tend to forget about everything else around you. I love that you get to interact and \"heal\" the marine creatures. Filling the aquarium tanks is also really fun. The thing that made me fall completely in love with this game though, is that after you think you are finished...you really aren't. There is still more to complete. I would recommend this game for anyone old enough to understand the basic commands of a Wii remote.

You can't go too far out of bounds or it just resets you to where you are \"supposed\" to be. I was finishing this game at a ridiculous rate without even having to try.

There are multiple levels and many different species of fish to find. They vary in weight and there are special fish in each lake. One of the things I like about this game is how much free range you have to drive the boat around. On a big screen this looks crazy cool!<br /><br />The kids enjoyed using the fishing pole after they got the hang of it and didn't have any further trouble with it. They liked doing the challenges and felt like kings of the fishing arena when they pulled in a big one. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes a pretty realistic fishing experience.",

The main reason for the three star rating, was that the first level was difficult to get past and so they kept doing it again and again until they tired of it. Since they couldn't get past that level, they soon grew frustrated. It wasn't bad, but I think for my seven and eight year old children it was a little too difficult.",

I loved the first one and have had hours upon hours of fun playing this game with my family and friends. This second incarnation still has adorable characters and much of the original functionality that the first had. There are some new critters to use ( I personally like the octopus,) and you now have the ability to throw certain things into pots or to other characters, which is a nice improvement. Some of the worlds are challenging and there are new hurdles to overcome, like flames popping up here and there that have to be put out. So there are some good things about it, however, there are also a lot of things that I found lacking.<br /><br />The levels are way too easy to earn points in. With the first game, you might be lucky if you served a handful of successful dishes and earned a couple of hundred points before the timer ran out. With the second game, you can easily earn more than a thousand points with hardly any effort. I was able to play through this game with my husband in a single afternoon and beat the final level without a problem, literally in less than six hours. That was not the way it was with the first game at all. Whereas in the original overcooked, the last level, when you face the giant meatball you have to really put your heads together and strategise and probably do it over and over again until you are successful, the final level in this game is easy. There isn't much holding you back from doing the level on the very first try.<br /><br />Some of the levels in this game are simply annoying rather than challenging in any meaningful kind of way. The things that made the first game challenging and fun were the rocking boats, the slippery ice and stuff like that. In this game it feels like they tried too hard to go out of their way to come up with hurdles for you and most of them are just ridiculous. You can easily get around most of them after you figure it out the first time and they don't change much throughout the rest of the game.<br /><br />The way the menu works annoyed me, because it isn't straight forward to change characters as you wish anymore like it was in the first game, and adding or subtracting players isn't easy anymore either. The emote icons are a pointless addition that does nothing to enhance the gameplay experience and don't work as well as they should. Overall, I thought this game was a massive disappointment. perhaps for those who haven't played the first one and don't have raised expectations based on that bar being set so high this would be a lot of fun, but for me, it was just barely okay. I hope if they come out with a third one they take into account what made the first one fun.",

I resented having to do such a big download even though I was capable of doing it. I feel sorry for the people who aren't able to download it.<br /><br />The graphics in the game look really good and there are a few changes, but nothing substantial enough to change the original feel and look of the game.

If you leave the battery packs in the controllers as they claim you can when you go to use the charger, it takes hours longer for them to charge, or in any event, for it to recognise that they are charged. Eventually it will charge them, and the battery packs fit nicely in the controllers, but it is rather a pain to use when you never really now if it is charged or not.<br /><br />At this point, I'm not sure what to think.",

But it also comes with a big annoying USB A cable which I can't get rid of. I understand the USB cable is for power which works the lights, etc, on this thing, but unlike the 2 cables which can be combined into one for smaller portable devices, the connection ports are just messy with a dangling USB cable if you don't need it.<br />In my personal opinion, there should be an option to detach the USB cable and/or have it plug into a null adapter on the TRS/TRRS adapter wire so it has somewhere to go. It just looks messy like this, and requires too many ports to look clean on a laptop even if you're using all of them. On a desktop this is less of an issue, however the logo still seems kind of cheesy on the side, so I guess I'm just not a fan of the aesthetics of this set. It DOES work however, so if all you want is the utility of it, it works alright.

                "text": "I love this keyboard. Yes, it is slightly smaller than a full sized keyboard, but it is SO SATISFYING to use. The keys are tall and have a big mechanical click like a vintage PC XT keyboard. The sound is audible and glorious, and the backlight LEDs really make it fun to look at too. I love turning it on and seeing the circles of light dancing around the keys to tell you its powering up.<br />Speaking of powering up, it has multiple device settings, which is something I haven't had in a BT keyboard before, or any Bluetooth device for that matter. Now that I have it I'm wondering why more Bluetooth devices don't offer this. I have it paired with my Amazon Fire stick, my phone, and our family Tablet, and a quick flip of the switch to 1, 2 or 3 can toggle which one is connected now. With other Bluetooth devices, it annoyingly usually just tries to repair with the last connected device  (especially frustrating with headphones!), but with this you can really use it with multiple devices and chose which one to reconnect to at power up. Brilliant!<br />I didn't notice any BT lag, but I understand this is something that is mostly noticeable by gamers who use wireless keyboards, and find it very irritating.  If you are concerned about that, thankfully this also has a wired mode directly over USB. I was a little bit uneasy to recommend this at first because of the price tag on it, but I'm really impressed with the device overall. It's worthy of 5 stars in my opinion.",

                "text": "I'm a fan of retro gaming, but installing 8 and 16-bit classics on modern tablets and phones is frustrating to say the least. You need buttons. That's where this adorable and super useful controller comes in. I love that it has several modes for different devices (act like a generic controller, a keyboard, a switch gamepad, etc), and I was able to use it both with a tablet and my Fire TV over bluetooth. It's really great on the Fire TV since the remote that comes with that stinks for gaming. The size is a little less comfortable than a full sized controller, but the portability is great. You can slip this in your pocket and take it out on a bus/train to play retro games on your phone. The button combos to switch modes are a little bit difficult to figure out at first, you need to use the instructions to understand how to set the mode and then put it into pairing to set it up with different devices. For example, hold one button and start for Switch mode, another button and start for Android mode, etc. Then press and hold the other button until it starts blinking to put it into pairing mode after that. And if you don't commit the button combinations to memory, you'll need to look it up in the instructions again. If you only intend to use this with one device, that's less of an issue as you'll probably just set it up once and never change it. But otherwise, I wish there was a cheat sheet or something printed on the back so you wouldn't need to keep the instructions around. All in all, it's still a very functional and great little remote game controller for a great price.",

Getting used to pressing the right one takes a bit of getting used to, but it's a very cool thing to have. The flashing colors are pretty cool looking and go along with the gamer styling like my gaming keyboard and Crucial RAM sticks that shift colors inside my PC case. The ergonomics are great, I actually find this mouse really comfortable to hold and use. The resolution and response is great, too. My only complaint is that I wish the speed button in the middle was harder to press by accident. My wife was using the desktop and accidentally pressed it, and the mouse started flying all over the place and she couldn't figured out how to go back to normal until came and pressed it again for her.<br />Otherwise, what a great product from Amazon Basics!",

                "text": "I noticed a lot of positive reviews for this so I had high hopes for sound quality. I see now that there are 3 different versions of this headset however, a wired standard 3.5mm TRRS one, a USB one, and a wireless one. I got the wireless one, which is also the most expensive version, and I have to admit I'm not impressed with the sound or features. With the glowing reviews, I have to believe the wired ones sound better and the culprit is in the transmitter. The quality of the sound over the wireless transmission is just OK. It's decent enough for VOIP and voice chats, maybe even gaming, but for music or watching videos it falls flat. I was watching a movie on Netflix and the dynamic range sort of collided with itself in such a way that it was hard for me to separate the voices from the background music compared to headphones that cost half as much as these.<br />That being said, I DO like the microphone and that it can be easily detached. For gamers that want wireless sound and mic for chats when needed, it can be a decent product when it works well. But that leads me to my next point:<br />The transmitter and headset seem to loose sync everytime one or the other shuts off. You you don't use the headset for a while, it seems to \"go to sleep\", and if the computer goes into sleep or hibernate, it doesn't seem to reconnect on its own upon waking up. I was trying this on my laptop and constantly felt like I had to power cycle the headset and unplug/plug the USB to get it connected again. Honestly, I feel like I could get a better connection experience and perhaps even sound quality from a pair of BT headphones, and just use my computer's bluetooth system to manage the connection upon waking up. If your computer doesn't have bluetooth, this system can be useful because it works like a USB sound card,  but honestly I feel like for the price they are asking it should have been a better experience.<br />Giving it 3 stars because it's fine for chats, is comfortable to wear and DOES look pretty cool. I just feel like you could do better. The wired versions are likely better.",

I'm happy to say the experience was positive, the headphones were comfortable to wear and the sound was excellent- definitely crisper and better bass response than the classic Apple buds I've been using on this laptop before trying these (and what I'm using for baseline comparison purposes). The microphone is excellent as well, I like that it aims in front of your mouth so it doesn't pick up ambient room noise and echo voice like other headsets which have the mic on the line or even worse, on the earphone itself (I've almost never had a good experience with a mic on your ear!). And the best feature is the way the mic will mute if you lift the mic boom arm up away from your face, and then come back when repositioned. A physical action like that is far better than a button or switch.<br />The only catch is that you need to be into the gamer's aesthetic. Someone in our home wanted to use these for Zoom meetings, and found that she didn't like looking like she had such a large headset- it didn't go with the look she wanted to have on camera. But that's no fault of this product, as gamer / audiophile 'phones are usually the bulky variety and it is expected. I think this is a really solid options for gamers.",

I got the pink variant, and the color makes her really happy- even the case is pink, which isn't how the last pair we got worked (only part of the ear buds were colored on that one, and not the case at all). The sound quality is pretty decent, more bass than expected and that's definitely a feature on smaller buds. The build quality was pretty good too, but I'm personally not a fan of touch-controls. I've owned a pair like them before and found that I would accidentally activate things every time I reseated them for comfort in my ear / keep them from falling out. My daughter says she doesn't mind this because she doesn't touch her ears as much when wearing them, so maybe this is something that doesn't effect all people. The microphone quality isn't great at isolating your voice, you get a lot of background noise but that's all common for this style of ear bud. It's not perfect, but for the money it's actually pretty good.",

For only a little bit more than the cost of a memory card, you can get this one already set up with everything you'd ever need or want. That's a reasonable argument.<br />And personally, I always said I wanted to do this to one of my Pi boards, but never did. Now that I've gotten an opportunity to try this, I see the value in not re-creating the wheel when someone has already put in the time for me.<br />I'm still a fan of DIY if you have the time and a spare card, but I'll happily spend the time I saved playing some classic Mario on this one.",

That means you can mix it up and swap hands as needed for games that you might require more dexterity with one hand vs the other! Or if you have friends that are different-brained than you, or perhaps you are ambidextrous... the possibilities go on!<br />Just measure first and make sure there's enough room.

The only downside to the headphone for me is the microphone, the bracket that holds the mic itself doesn't feel like it's made of the same sturdy material as the rest, so I am a little bit concerned with it holding up over time.

                "text": "This game couldve been so good, but it turned out to be somewhat of a poor game. First the good.  Combat mechanics are fun, not great like dark souls, but its fun.  The magic spells are fun to use and execute throughtout the game. The ability to change out spells in mid combat makes it not a complete real-time combat, but thats fine.  Its a nice compromise considering you are limited to using a joystick.  The graphics are good for its time, if not a little gray.  But it becomes really good and the colors and motion become much richer and fluid with an upscaler.<br /><br />The bad:  Dialogue, I appreciate that they are trying to wax poetical but its too verbose. I understand that they had alot to say, and alot of ideas, but they werent organized very well. Its also not elegantly written either.  Its just all over the place.  That being said, it does have to be translated so its probably better in Japanese.  If you take a look at games like Demon's souls, Dark souls, Bloodborne, you dont have to write volumes to get the point across that life is harsh, brutal and cold, but with some beauty sprinkled into what we call life that sometimes makes it all seem worthwhile.  Souls series does it through focusing intensely on creating a visual atmosphere and sparse dialogue that hints at what is.  But what this series does is try to expound verbally, what can hardly be expressed through words.  Even the epilogue is completely verbal.  Could they not just throw in some animations to carry the message and make it worth watching?<br /><br />That brings me to the next huge negative- Kaine.  She could arguably be the most annoying supporting character Ive run across.  Even her walking around half naked couldn't make up for it.  She could even beat the handler in Monster Hunter World.  The only saving grace is that you don't hear Kaine all the time unlike the handler. And at least in the PC version of monster hunter world you can mute her and even change her face. Thank goodness for that. In any case, I understand what they were trying to do, make a volatile, seemingly complex character, likeable by helping the player empathize with her background through small but meaningful moments throughout the game. But no, it just fails to work. Perhaps the Japanese version works, but this utterly fails imo.<br /><br />The last negative- Music.  Sound quality is fine. but the music is so repetitive. If they were going to recycle the same music over and over again, could they not use low impact, no vocal instrumentals?  Or just use it once in a while to create a nice, lasting impact? Its fine to hear the full track a few times, but over and over again, it just becomes hard to bear.  This is really a huge negative as music is a huge part of any game.  They need to master things like this, which I will say, in the newest Nier Automata game, they seem to have done.  So bravo for that.<br /><br />All in all, this game is not necessary to play Nier Automata, a complete standaline, which so far plays like a masterpiece of a game in all areas.  You can avoid this game and really not miss a thing.",

                "text": "Im usually very critical when it comes to products. But when they work and they are good, I give them their due.  I rather NOT spend 100 bucks on this thing. But it works and it works well.  It upgrades your consoles whether your console directly outputs via HDMI or has to go through upscaler like an OSSC.  It improves the visuals output from every single console from retro to ps4.  The colors generally are richer and images are cleaner with more depth.<br /><br />For example, I have a RGB modded Genesis Model 1 Non TMSS with every improvement you can think of to soup it up to get the best visuals possible.  The problem is the tech is old and so you are prone to some blurriness when random motion occurs.  If you are used to slow paced games, then you wont get the max benefit from it, but you still will because of how much it cleans up the signal making it look nearly HD.  Most reviewers show static pictures or pre-recorded intros rather than actually playing on the thing to show how effective it is.<br /><br />Fast paced, quick random motions- this is where its improvement is noticeable.  It produces a smooth experience.  It wont add more pixels or any of that.  But it will clean up the image and get rid of that haze that your console is producing. This will make the image look richer, NOT brighter.  It will also actually seem to reduce the lag in your gameplay because of the clarity and smoothness of the relayed video.  You will respond much quicker because of this.  If you like shooters like I do, it is helpful here.  Also, the 4:3 mode is very nice.  When using OSSC on some modes it stretches the image mode too much and this helps bring the image back into a more proper ratio. YMMV<br /><br />On a PS3/PS4 you should get a similar improvement, but in a subtle way, believe it or not.  If you have a discerning eye, it will be readily apparent.  Games like Nier, which has an obscene amount of blurriness, will greatly improve. Colors look richer and visuals will have more depth.  PS3 and PS4 are especially prone to blurriness because of the heavy demand on the processors.  When you pop in the McCLassic, its like playing on your PC without the additional resolution. Just more clarity, richer colors, rock steady visuals.  I play alot of Bloodborne, and your reaction time will be better because of the reduced motion blur and increased clarity.  If you get one, turn the MCClassic on and play it for a while.  If you dont see the difference turn it off after a while by putting it on bypass mode. You will never go back to it off.  You can see this clarity clearly in scenes where there is fog rendered.  I hadnt noticed the fog as much before, but with the McCLassic, it adds so much more to the experience.  Did I mention reduced lag experience?  Those times you got hit and you swore you didnt see what hit you? Thatll happen much less often, if at all. When you get hit, you'll know why.<br /><br />As for whether its worth it?  If the above doesnt convince you and dont find as much worth in it and assuming you get marginal improvement, think of it this way. If you own more than 1 console, and you own an HDMI switcher and you plug it in the output, you can effectively upgrade every single console you own. Divide the price by how many consoles you own and thats the real cost for the upgrade.<br /><br />Cons<br />You need to reset the Mclassic from time to time. For whatever reason, when you switch consoles and it puts out different resolutions, the image doesnt register.  This happens rarely so far.  I believe this is when it usually doesnt work temporarily.  The only solution is not to go to bypass mode, but to completely unplug the mini/ micro HDMI power cord from the Mclassic and power it down. Plug it back in and you're good to go.  Assuming this issue doesnt keep cropping up as well as other potential issues, its a straight up buy recommendation. I will update as I spend more time on it.<br /><br />Edit: I use OSSC line doubler. X in photos 2x,3x, etc.  can only get 2x line doubling with ossc + m because of the unstable output from OSSC. (May be related to the retro console itself rather OSSC.)<br /><br />UPDATE: Still works fine as it is supposed to.  Any issues encountered in switching as noted in this review and comments below can be solved by simply unplugging the power and hard resetting it.  Even if its on \"off mode.\"  Another item I would like to add since Ive had this since its inception is that some people may prefer the pixelated blocky look.  Personally, I like this blocky look, but it only looks good when you have razer sharp output from your console, which usually takes modding, decent monitor and, what people dont mention, power quality.  If you have poor power quality, it will affect your visuals.  However, solving power/electricity quality issues costs more than this upscaler.  Having a good power/electricity source, I prefer to NOT use the Mclassic just because I love the blocky, crisp, detailed look.  Improving the quality of your power/electricity source will make everything look and sound exponentially better WITHOUT altering the original content. Doing this is better than the result you get from MClassic.  However, it costs more and takes experimentation and certainly not easy to do.  All in all, Mclassic is an easy way to upgrade your experience.",

Its dark, its foreboding and its beautiful  Its not about having super fast reflexes, dodging a million bullets at a million MPH, which has its place and is fine for other SHMUPs, but this franchise is different- you weave your way through traffic as if you are in the matrix- thoughtfully and deliberately, moving your force back and forth and angling them at just the right place.  As the game moves along, it builds upon each stage, getting darker and presenting you with more unique and interesting challenges and bosses.<br /><br />This game should be played with sound via the digital out port of the PS2 and into your stereo, properly attuned for best sound. Video wise either you use a component cable or RGB and have it line doubled via an OSSC or the like.  It will be worth it because they did not skip on any facet of the game.  It will suck you right in. Unlike other games which sound like you are in a techno club, (which can be fun) this game takes a different route and throws you into the midst of a cinematic experience with the quality sound and visuals.<br /><br />This is one of those buy and keep games, no matter what console comes next.",

I like that it doesn’t feel heavy but it feels too light. If you have ever held an 8bitdo controller you know how solid it feels yet it is light. This does not.  They really should have used the extra plastic on the controller instead of the “fancy” packaging. 8bitdo  used the cheapest packaging possible and saved the plastic for the controller, yet it was all tastefully well done and executed.<br />2) Tactile feedback is lacking. Compared to 8bitdo, very poor.  Retrobit's you can kind of tell you pressed the button because you pressed the button but there is absolutely no feedback. If feels loose and flimsy. As if the buttons can just come off. This goes for the D pad as well which does not feel solid and responsive. There is a feeling of hollowness.<br /><br />3)  USB connection to Nintendo switch is not 100% supported apparently because it seems to lose its connectivity midway through use at times. This can be sporadic- I don’t know why it happens. This is also not strictly limited to USB. I also bought a Genesis receiver and while it seems to work on the majority of the games I have tried one game in particular- terminator sega cd, does not work properly for whatever reason.<br /><br />4) most importantly connectivity.  It works on its saturn and genesis. BUT there is noticeable latency.  Easy to see/experience if you play streetfighter or any fighters.  Pulling out next to last second uppercuts are very difficult. Use a wired joystick/controller and its back to normal.<br /><br />With that being said,  This is the only wireless solution for Saturn.  Its a nice controller overall especially but mainly bc it is relatively cheap BUT only if you arent playing games that require instant responses.<br /><br />Best controller is the original WIRED saturn controller obviously.",

Its nothing like the original genesis's improved controller.  That one by far is the best I have ever used.<br />4) Connectivity is superb. You never lose connection and responsiveness is good. Latency ill have to do more testing. This is obviously one of the most important qualities. It is a good thing that they did not stop there and went the whole 9 yards with the controller itself.

Add a pair of analog stick height extenders and you are set.",

                "text": "4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />This remake, overall, is excellent.  However, what plagues this game is what seems to plague a lot of the modern games which is that while it is technically superior to its predecessor, it doesn’t quite live up to the same level of emotional experience that you would get by playing the original. I am not saying this just to be an originalist or a video game snob. Here are the reasons:<br /><br />1)  The musical arrangements are elevator musicesque in some ways. Compare opening sequence. It doesnt have the sense of doom and dread that you have with the original. The opening cutscene art direction suffers from this as well, albeit still stunning.<br /><br />2) visuals are fantastic and so detailed and is a wonder to see BUT it also detracts in a way bc it takes away from this dream state like nightmarish experience.  Don’t get me wrong I love the new visuals but I became more of an observer than one who was actually experiencing. The PC emulation version was great for that reason, retaining the dream state like experience but with updated technicals with 60 FPS performance. That was really what PS3 version lacked. It would have been great if they could have included a technically updated ps3 version as well on the ps5 or even be able to play original ps3 discs with improved performance like xbox series x is doing with all their legacy titles.  As an aside this is why I am a huge fan of the new xbox again.<br /><br />3) for all its beautiful graphics and performance, what happened to the wonderful cut scene artwork that was in the PS3? They added depth and substance to the game. It wasn’t just an afterthought. While I grant you that the load times are so fast that it would have been hard to have the time to appreciate it. Why not at least include a section for it as a homage.<br /><br />Anyways still an absolute must play.",

Very easy to pull off split second moves. the stick and buttons are light, quick and responsive.  Low effort and accurate.  Its lighter than a sanwa, which in turn is lighter than the seimitsu.  The only thing necessary to swap out imo is to replace the square gate with an octagate.  For reference I have other Hori arcade pro sticks- 2 and 3. Also a few other retro sticks.<br /><br />I prefer the shape of this stick vs the other Hori ones, which are too wide.  Why would you need anything that wide?  The shape and size of this model is similar to the RAP 1, 2, 3.<br /><br />Overall, almost perfect imo.  But can we get a wireless 2.4ghz version? Its 2021!",

Id pay more for that.<br /><br />Another suggestion for Mayflash would be to create a saturn to multi retro console converter.  Saturn on one end and snes/megadrive/pc engine on the other.

Its too shallow and have to press firmly for a decent response.<br /><br />The 2.4 GHz aspect of the controller works fine. No issues. However, it does not make up for the D pad issue. Personally I would rather use something with a better D pad with Bluetooth if I have to.<br /><br />As of now I just swapped in Im my PS 1 to snes adapter. And then plugged in an old wireless ps1 logitech receiver /controller with a superior D pad.  (For those who dont mind wires- performance ps1 dpad is one of the best and happens to be very cheap used)  It does end up costing more, but not having to aggravate about the D pad is worth it plus with the converter you can actually use a real joystick on the SNES for shmups and whatever else you can think of.<br /><br />Their other controllers arent any better. The NES is the worst of the controllers. The Genesis is a bit better but not as comfortable as the original.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Tried to figure out the cause of the poor performance.  I was able to improve the responsiveness by cleaning up the dpad pcb with a cotton swab and IPA.  Its new but why so dirty? Possibly these pcbs have been laying around the warehouse for a while before entering production. Who really knows but now the responsiveness is instant and feels a bit better but still the dpad design needs work because it still is not comfortable. I still prefer the other solution even if it isnt as cheap/elegant.",

Not on the level of a Demon's soul remake, but still nice.  Whats important is that they kept to the spirit of the original.<br /><br />My favorite part of the game is how wonderfully they redid the music.  For me, retrogaming is a good part about the music.  I didnt think Id like it because I enjoyed the original so much.  It was quite tastefully done.  I think everyone will enjoy it.  The only bad part is the option to play original compositions.  It didnt come out so well.  They must have paid very little attention to the transfer.  The original compositions come off somewhat harsh.  They shouldve borrowed my original SNES, which is modded for digital audio output with upgraded caps, audio quality internal wiring and power supply.<br /><br />Main quibble with the game is the voice acting. Budget must have run thin considering they may have had trouble gauging what kind of reception the game would garner. Id opt for the japanese voiceover, although the English voiceover for Popoi is fantastic.<br /><br />I really like that they added character development scenes, but the drawback is I ended up liking certain characters less- probably due to poor voice acting.<br /><br />The other nitpicks are some of the animations which are needlessly long and drawn out- i.e., when talking to an NPC.  Otherwise the art work is very nice.<br /><br />The other notable thing is the difficulty. It has been modernized so that you can beat it without any effort or grinding. Kind of sad really.  I dont like the grinding, which is fine. But the difficulty is skewed too much to the easy side for the bosses.<br /><br />Overall, I think the gameplay experience is much better on the SNES even though this version is very much worth experiencing for the music, upgraded artwork and additional scenes.",

Looks quality.<br /><br />* Assembly not too involved if you dont have two left hands (or right if you're lefty)<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Plastic not as good as OEM.  Noticed a crack on tabs and some falling off after assembly and reassembly.  Main problem with back buttons is that the plastic seems to wear down or get bent out of shape just enough that it doesnt make enough solid contact with the pcb trigger.  This is a huge issue bc it results in missed inputs and the trigger no longer “clicks”. I had to return mine and get a new one after about 3 weeks.<br /><br />* Somewhat cramped. I have average to above average size hands and I keep accidentally pressing the middle buttons.  Itll take getting used to since Ive used the razer xbox, razer ps4, ps4 backbutton attachments and xbox elite.  The others have a more comfortable layout for me. Still great.  Just happy they have something for PS5<br /><br />Ultimately though the biggest problem is the cheap plastic that they use. Otherwise design is fine. I just hope that they can address this issue in future revisions. I see that they will be making a real metal button option which would address the main issue I have. Still highly recommend it Since there really isn’t any other alternative.  Itd get 4 to 5 stars if it wasnt for the cheap plastic.",

                "text": "[[VIDEOID:499ac84584cf56f9db85b46180571b61]] This is my first experience with Thrustmaster and a wheel in general.  My expectations based on price and the Thrustmaster name were not completely met with the T128P for PS4/5 and PC.  It’s a great $100 wheel but slightly above average $200 wheel.  Primary user of the wheel is my 12 year old son but for testing purposes I have been driving race cars like I stole them, lol.<br /><br />Arrival:  The wheel arrived nicely package all component were in working order with no issues.  However, I immediately notice some of the creature comforts I expected were missing based on price of the wheel such as cushion wheel or higher quality buttons with smooth action.<br /><br />Instructions:  Th instruction for setup were clear except for the computer driver download portion. A little more emphasis and larger font would be nice.  Took me a second to locate them due to size of font.<br /><br />Wheel:  The wheel itself is made of hard plastics, buttons appear of low quality and make a loud audible click when pushed, especially the paddles shifters.  They lack the quality you see with PS5 and the Xbox elite 2 controllers.  The clamp worked fine but make sure you have room underneath your desk to attach, see pictures.<br /><br />Pedals:  I have similar thoughts when it comes to the pedals.  The pedals assembly is very light and lack common sense in the design.  It doesn’t take and engineer to understand center of gravity and how a lever works.  To explain the pedals will slide forward when in use and have a tendency to want to pitch forward off the floor due the center of gravity begin shifted so far forward and the lack of weight to counter this affect.  The design seemed to completely overlook that someone had to actually use this in game under various conditions.  I guess that is why a pedal stand is sold by Thrustmaster as an accessory for ~$90.  Just my thoughts but human in the loop and ergonomics should be considered in the design process hint…hint.  You have to hold the pedals in place with your off foot, use a weight or hey buy their pedal stand.<br /><br />Hooking up:  Once everything was hooked up it was first tested on the PS5 with no issues.  Worked well with GT7. For the computer…driver download was easy.  Thrustmaster done have control panel for making adjustments to the settings.  We first tried with Forza 4 and had issues.  The game would not recognize the wheel.  However, after some internet research we found this is a common issue across many brands of wheels and Forza 4. I found no immediate work around so we tried using the wheel with Forza 5.  The wheel was recognized as a T248 and Forza auto-configured the wheel. The wheel worked as intended with all features being functional.  My son did adjust the button layout to his liking.  When also tried the wheel with the Crew 2 demo and it worked but not as well.  Not all function worked on the wheel, mainly the center shift lights were not operable. This could be due to the game being only a demo though.<br /><br />So to wrap this up the wheel is a good beginner wheel but without the creature comforts I expected for the price point. The design lacks in key areas of functionality and quality, especially regarding the pedals and use of quality components such as buttons. The dynamic functionality of the wheel lacks the feel I expected and in my opinion is cheap considering the price.<br /><br />Note:  the cord routing and layout could have been incorporated better considering it is a clamp on type mount.  The cords are easily pinch during mounting and do not stay in the routing channels.<br /><br />My review is solely based on my experience with this wheel and isn’t biased as I have never owned another.",

Forward and back buttons work as intended. It does have an auto off feature that increases battery life if not used for a period of time.  Wiggling the mouse brings it out of hibernation.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the design.  Due to the curve of the base my forth and fifth fingers do not have a comfortable resting spot.  I can live with it but that should have been taken into consideration.  I have small hands and a person with larger hands is likely to have more of an issue.",

                "text": "THE BOTTOM LINE - Getting the headphones and mic to work properly took some irritating effort for a newbie but was worth it for how it immediately enhanced my online gaming.<br /><br />The headphones themselves are nice. The sound is excellent and the headset is the most comfortable for extended wear I've found yet. Wireless Bluetooth speakers often stutter while streaming audio but these non-Bluetooth headphones worked flawlessly. The controls are positioned a bit awkwardly, on the lower back end of the right side ear cup. I've hit the wrong controls several times while trying to do something as simple as adjusting the volume.<br /><br />The set up was extremely irritating for me. The minimal directions are on one very large sheet with 95% of the content being the same few sentences in a myriad of different languages. I don't mind multi-lingual instructions, it was just the layout on this particular broadsheet that was frustrating. I had to keep flipping from one side of the sheet to the other trying to figure out what to do. Then it took me 20 minutes to get the headset to actually work simply because I had pushed the USB cords in as far as they seemed to go but they needed to be pushed in even further.A google search showed that folks have had similar problems with other Astro gear. Someone used to these kinds of headsets will probably have a much easier time but for a first timer like me, this was a very irritating exercise indeed. It turns out that the Astro website has a set up video that is dramatically easier to understand than the included instructions so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Then, after I finally got the headphones plugged in and working, it turns out I can't get the mic to work. A google search did not help here as people have had problems with a variety of Astro gear but I couldn't find anything pertaining to mic issues with this particular headset. About 45 minutes ago I put in a support request on the Astro website. So I  also get to test how good their support it. Once I've dealt with them and hopefully gotten the mic working, I'll update this review and adjust the rating accordingly.<br /><br />EDIT: Upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.  Customer service got back to me within a day as promised. They gave me a check list of things to try (included below). Testing the headphones on a different computer was the one that worked for me. They worked flawlessly on a different machine so the mic problem had something to do with my first computer, not with the headphones themselves. The reason for moving the ratings upwards to 5 stars is that setting up and using the mic was pretty straightforward and using the mic opened up new game realms for me. Just now I used headphones and mic for the first time ever in an online game, running some missions with my guildmates. Being able to talk to my guildies was a whole new level of companionable gaming, one I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />Even with the 5 star rating though, I do have to reiterate a caution I gave earlier in this review. Using this gear will likely be a cakewalk for a techie who knows what they are doing. For a newbie though, getting to the sweet spot with this gear took some frustrating effort. If you are a newbie, I suggest that you start with the appropriate astro a20 set up video on youtube and if you have any problems, try this checklist from Astrogaming support. Good luck.<br /><br />The suggested trouble-shooting checklist:<br />  - Watch the set up video to check your settings.<br /><br />  - Check to make sure your A20’s Base Station is in PC Mode. The PC/Console Mode switch is located on the back of the Base Station.<br /><br />  - Resync the A20 Headset by plugging the headset into the A20 Base Station as if it were charging.<br /><br />  - Test the alternate USB ports on on your computer. Test your equipment on an alternate computer or console. Use a different voice program (Discord, Skype, Teamspeak, etc.)<br /><br />  - Hard reset your A20 Headset by simultaneously holding down the GAME Button (Located below the volume wheel) and the EQ Mode button located below the power button. Please note: When doing the hard reset, have the headset plugged in directly to a confirmed power source, without the Base Station. Let charge for 15 minutes, then retry.",

                "text": "EDIT: I'm leaving my original review below to show you why I initially loved this keyboard and gave it a glowing 5 star review. Sadly, just a few days after posting that review things took a sudden turn for the worse. For unknown reasons the G Hub software controlling this keyboard crashed and burned completely. Not only is it no longer working beyond the basics but the crash also pushed the keyboard into default mode. That means the extra macro keys that were so helpful in my game reverted to being standard F1-F5 function keys. My game already uses those function keys for essential combat moves so now, after deliberately training my muscle memory to use the macro keys, those keys do entirely different things.. Even a casual gamer like me knows how that destroys one's game play.<br /><br />A google search showed that this G Hub crash is a common enough occurrence that there are YouTube videos and reddit articles on how to try and deal with it. I followed some of the basic suggestions - rebooting the computer, reinstalling the software, unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in again, all to no avail. The G Hub loading screen just spins endlessly and I have no way of altering the default settings of this keyboard. The next step is to trying dealing with Logitech support, which does not have a good reputation online. At 70 years old, I'm too tired to deal with much hassle so I don't know when  I'll have the energy to take that on. If they can't, or won't, help me, the rating on this review will go even lower. If they can show me how to fix the problem, the rating will stay at 3 stars or possibly go back up to 4 stars depending on how much difficulty is involved. In any event, the first bloom of 5 star love is definitely over.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />First, let's give this review some context. As a retired guy I'm too old and slow to be a hard core gamer. I have five grandsons in high school and junior high who are hard core and their game play is in a whole different universe than mine. This review is not for them. I'm a relaxed, casual player and that's who this is written for. With that in mind, let's move on to this keyboard, starting with the fun stuff.<br /><br />Fun - The Bright and Shiny Lights<br />A lot of gear branded for gamers seems to feature brightly colored lights and this keyboard revels in them. Before it arrived I wondered why it bothered to even have lights. When I first took the keyboard out of the box and plugged it in, the lights were so bright and were flashing so quickly that I was like \"Whoa, how the heck can I even use this thing?? Those lights are just way too distracting and confusing!!!\" Silly me. When I downloaded the control software I quickly discovered that I could tune the keyboard to my own liking, using other people's lighting designs or easily create my own. With a vast array of colors to choose from as well as a variety of shifting patterns and lighting sequences, I happily set about creating a lighted keyboard I really, really liked. Heck, you can set each key to have it's own color sequence if  you want and you control how much the whole thing flashes and how often it all changes color. As far as I can tell, the colored lights have no impact on my game play but it's like having your own Christmas light show all year round and I love it! Why would anyone want one of those old, unlighted keyboards?<br /><br />Fun - Clicky, Clicky, Clicky and Other Sound Stuff<br />When you order one of these keyboards you have have a choice of three different keyboard sounds. I got the Clicky version which sounds and feels a bit like an old school typewriter. The sound is unobtrusive but nice. I couldn't tell you why but that clicking in the background as you type feels comfortable to me. It's letting you know that you are actually doing something when you hit the keys. Again, why would anyone want one of those old, noiseless keyboards? They are so boring.  🙂<br /><br />Another sound thing is the volume control on the keyboard. I don't particularly need it with my current set up as I have a small speaker, with volume control sitting right next to my keyboard. Still, my previous computer was an all-in-one who's volume control was awkward to use. So the keyboard mounted volume control would have been handy then.<br /><br />The Serious Game Stuff - Macros and More Macros<br />Here's where we get down to the serious stuff. For those who don't know, macros are small scripts for doing a series of actions by pressing one key instead of having to press one for each action. For example, say you are playing a cowboy shooter and you ride into an ambush. You need to dismount, draw a rifle or pistol, aim, shoot, and reload when necessary. Normally each of those actions would require a separate key stroke. With a macro though, you could set it up to do all that with one key instead. As you can imagine, macros can be powerful, powerful tools in the game world. They are so powerful that the main game I play forbids using macros for more than one action at a time. Even with that limitation, the macro capability of this keyboard is still very useful.<br /><br />There are five new keys on the left side of this keyboard that can be assigned to any use you'd like. Currently I have them set up to quickly mount and dismount from the various critters I can ride. That in and of itself is nice. However, you can also set up different macros on those keys which can be swapped in and out at the push of a button. There are a variety of professions and skills I can use ingame so if I wanted to, I could set up different macros to use with different characters in addition to the mounting/dismounting. I haven't done that yet but I fully intend to.<br /><br />Just as nice is that the control software makes macro creation easy peasy.  The control interface is minimalist in design and you have to poke around a bit to figure out how to use it but the learning curve is not onerous and once you have figured it out. using the software makes macro creation incredibly easy.<br /><br />In case you can't tell, even as a casual gamer I love this keyboard. Hard core gamers will probably appreciate it even more than I do.",

The teeny tiny instructions direct you to a website to download a driver. It took a bit to find the correct download on their site and when installed it doesn't seem to do anything. The download did put a shortcut on my desktop but when I double click the shortcut or the application file directly, nothing happens. The mouse itself works the same as it did before installing the driver. If I click the DPI button it does indeed change the cursor movement on the screen but there is no way for me to know what the actual setting is. So if I accidentally click that button again, it's a matter of blindly clicking until I get back to that setting or something close to it. Also, for my gaming style, a 6 button mouse doesn't offer much more flexibility than a regular mouse. The two extra buttons aren't enough to make a significant difference in my game play. So as a regular mouse it works just fine with some pretty lights flashing continuously.  As a gaming mouse it doesn't do much for me.",

                "text": "As a cranky old guy who spends a lot of his retirement time gaming in MMOs, I had some mixed reactions to to these headphones. On the plus side, they really are plug and play. No special software is needed, no tricky set up issues, just plug them in and they are good to go. MMO means massive multi-player online and it generally indicates the kind of game where you cooperate with some players while combating others. In a situation like that, headphones with a mic are essential to fast coordination. Gamers I know generally use Discord or Teamspeak to verbally communicate with each other. Once again, the set up was basically plug and play.  With the headphones connected to my computer, I had no problem using them with either of those programs.<br /><br />There were a few things that kept me from giving these headphones 5 stars. For one thing, the sound is okay but is nothing special to write home about. That's fine for gaming but if want to listen to music or watch movies, you'll probably want to switch back to your regular speakers. Which touches on another thing, this one positive. Some headphones and mics show up as unique items in my audio settings. So when I want to use them I have to plug them in and go into my settings to select them. This headphone and mic just show up as generic default input/output devices in my settings. So I can just plug them in without having to also adjust my settings.<br /><br />Another negative is how flimsy the headphones feel. It took some effort to pull the earphones out enough to fit them properly on my head. It felt like I might break the thing if I pulled too hard so it took a bit to get the earphones extended as far as I need them. Moreover, the padding under the headpiece is similar to other headsets I've tried, only to have that padding  rip and fall apart after only a few months of use. One other positive should be mentioned. There's an on/off switch for the mic on the headphone's cord. That's very handy as a mic that's always open can lead to echoes and squealing feedback that the other folks playing with you will not appreciate.<br /><br />Oh, and there is one neutral thing to close with. Like most \"gamer equipment\" these headphones come equipped with pretty lights. That always seems like a silly marketing ploy to me, one aimed at 11 year old gamers. Those pretty lights are even more ridiculous than usual on a pair of headphones. The headphones are on your head, you can't even see those pretty lights like you can with a keyboard, mouse, or other \"gamer gear\".<br /><br />So all in all, this headset/mic seems like it will do the basic audio job I need it for, talking with other gamers in the midst of fiercely fought battles. There's just nothing outstanding enough about it to boost its rating up from 4 stars to 5.",

                "text": "The sound is very good. The headset is perhaps the most lightweight and comfortable I've used so far. It's also completely plug and play. You plug the headphones in and you are good to go, no drivers or other software needed. Some headphones show up as unique items under the audio settings. So when you want to use them, you need to go to your settings to manually select them after you plug them in. Not these. Just unplug your speakers, plug in the headset and go from there.<br /><br />A lot of manufacturers seem to think all gamers are middle school kids who need and want flashing lights on everything. The last set of \"gaming\" headphones I tried put ridiculous colored lights on the headphones. I say ridiculous because you can't see those lights when you are actually wearing the headset. So I appreciate the fact that this headset eschewed such nonsense, focusing instead on audio quality and the comfortableness of the headset.<br /><br />There are two cautions I need to add. Though neither was a big deal to me, you should be aware of them. The first is that the cord on this headset is shorter than other headsets I've used. My set up is a main computer that I actually game on with a second computer to the side that I run Discord on. That way I don't have to flip in and out of the game to deal with Discord issues. The cord on this headset is fine for use with my main computer but is too short to reach the secondary machine. Depending on your set up, the length of the cord may or may not be an issue to you.<br /><br />For me that also means I haven't tried the microphone on this headset, just the headphones. Given the quality of this product I wouldn't expect there to be an issue with the mic, but you might check the other reviews here to see what they say about that. Thanks for reading this and I hope you enjoy this product.",

                "text": "As a casual gamer I can't tell if this keyboard is serious overkill for me, is just filled with unnecessary frills, or is some combination of both. In any event, it has no noticeable impact on my gaming.<br /><br />Let me give a bit of context. As an old, retired guy in the midst of a pandemic, I actually have a lot of time for gaming and easily spend 6+ hours a day in my favorite MMO. I call myself a casual gamer because I am too old and slow to be a hardcore, competitive player. So I don't play to beat others but to simply have a good time. My favorite MMO is Guild Wars 2, which has a variety of game modes, from relaxed casual to hardcore competitive. One of those game modes, World vs World is a series of open maps where players can roam as  individuals, in small groups, or in massive zergs fighting  other players to capture keeps, towers, supply camps, shrines, and the like. It's a nice mix of casual and competitive and even an old, slow guy like me can run wild there and the ingame rewards available make it worthwhile to do so. The action is fast-paced, fluid, and always changing and I usually spend a couple of hours a day or so in WvW.<br /><br />That's the context in which I tried this keyboard and it worked no better than the basic $15 keyboard I had unplugged to try this one. Guild Wars 2 does not allow the use of macros so that feature did me no good at all.  Roccat's macro set up seem clumsy anyway. You need to hit two keys, while looking at the keyboard to get the right ones. Other keyboards I've seen have a much better implementation of macros. My favorite option was one that had a dedicated set of extra buttons just for the macros. One button to hit  and once you got the muscle memory down, you wouldn't have to look at the keyboard to hit the right key.<br /><br />The \"swift, precise key stroke\" touted in the product copy had no practical effect for me. At times when my group was being swamped by a larger enemy horde, making swift action imperative, this keyboard seemed no faster than the basic keyboard it had replaced. Several times I had to hit a key twice before it responded.<br /><br />Even something as simple as the audio controls seem clumsily implemented on this keyboard. There's three buttons and a knob. One button is for muting. One says FX and I still haven't figured out what it's for. The third button seems to turn the volume knob on, and the knob then adjusts the volume. The basic keyboard this one replaced had three audio control buttons - mute, volume up, volume down. Much simpler.<br /><br />This is also not a plug and play product like basic keyboards are. After plugging it in, I had to go to the company website to download the necessary software. Once that was installed, I had to download/install an update. Once that first update was installed, I immediately had to download/install a second update. Not only was it a lengthy process, but the keyboard locked itself down during the download/install process, meaning I couldn't do other things on the computer while all that was being done.<br /><br />Once all the software and updates were finally installed, I learned how unnecessarily irritating it was to use the software. The only instructions included with the keyboard were to go to the company website to download the needed software. On the website itself, there were no directions for actually using the software. So for me, it was a clumsy, hunt and peck process, trying different buttons to figure out how to do such basic things as set the color scheme, select the sound played when hitting a key, and set the profiles to change those settings depending on what I was doing. The company website was very pretty to look at but some simple step by step instructions for using their products would have been much more useful.<br /><br />That description of the company website, \"pretty to look at but of no practical use\" is pretty much the way I would describe this keyboard. Yes, the lights are pretty. Yes, it's fun to choose the sound that plays when you hit a key but none of that does a thing to improve my gaming. The local ants really do seem to like this keyboard though. This morning when I sat down at my desk, they were swarming all over it, running around through its maze of colored lights. I have no idea what that was about but they seemed to be having fun.",

                "text": "These headphones really do have the deepest, richest, most immersive in-game sound field I've heard yet from any headphones or speakers in the under $100 price range. For me though, that is not enough for a 5-star rating. Your mileage may vary of course, depending on how you use headphones but let me lay out the issues I had with this headset.<br /><br />While the in-game sound was awesomely good, the audio quality for movies and tv shows as well as music and audiobooks were the same as most other headsets and speakers in this price range. The MMO I play the most has separate volume controls for music, environmental sounds, dialogue, and special effects while movies, music, etc, generally have a single volume control. I don't begin to understand the technical issues involved but that may have something to do with why these headphones can take the different sound files in a game and weave them into a very real sounding, three-dimensional sound field while being unable to do so for other types of audio files. Where this becomes an issue for me, and where your mileage may vary, is in what I use headphones for.<br /><br />There's two times I plug in headphones - when I'm gaming with fellow players via Discord or when I'm listening to something loud at night and I don't want to disturb my upstairs neighbor. Other than that, I don't use headphones to listen to the sounds of my video game. Instead, I'll be listening to music or audiobooks on some decent computer speakers while gaming solo. Their sound for such things is as good as these headphones. The advantage of speakers is they don't start getting uncomfortable after extended use, like headsets do for me.<br /><br />Which brings us to another issue I had with this headset. The product page touts their comfortableness. When I first put them on, they did feel more comfortable than other headsets I've used. After two hours of running ingame raids with some guildies though, the headphones were becoming uncomfortable. I was glad when we finished our group raid so I could sign off of Discord and take off the headphones.<br /><br />So it really comes down to how you use headphones. If you game with them on all the time and are comfortable wearing a headset for an extended period, you will love this product and it will likely be 5-star headset for you. If not though, this item will likely drop to 4-stars for you, excellent in one area but average in most others.",

The Oculus Rift is by far the most fun I’ve had with video games in some time.<br /><br />When it comes to the actual physical system, I’ve noticed a significant amount of complaints with the excess wires. The Touch System includes the headset, 2 sensors, and 2 wireless remotes. The headset requires an HDMI port and USB, each sensor requires a USB port. I can admit the wires can be a bit frustrating, but honestly I really haven’t noticed them at all. In fact I’ve actually used the wire from the headset as a reference to stay centered in the room.<br /><br />The tracking is amazing and the boundaries you set up for yourself around the room make punching the wall a rarity. The controllers, as designed, feel like natural hand motions and are easy to use even with my toddler hands. The headset is a bit big for my tiny-ass head, but no one else seems to complain about it, so I’ll live with it. All the features lead to a truly immersed feeling for the player.<br /><br />I am really blown away by this system, along with everyone I’ve also had try it out. If you’re even questing the Rift, the answer is yes. For the love of god yes.",

                "text": "I have one of the older Kindles and the only complaint that I have had over the years is that while traveling or at night, I can't read without some kind of light. Of course I have purchased various independent lights that either snap-on or attach to my old case, but this also means keeping up with two things (the Kindle and the light). So I finally asked myself \"wouldn't it be easier to invest in one product that would offer both protection and light\"? So I purchased this case and have not been disappointed! I'm glad I made the investment.<br /><br />For the cost of the case, you get:<br /><br />1. A sleek, attractive case that not only looks smart but is extremely functional.  This case is made from a leather (a durable material) on the outside, and is well padded (in a charcoal grey material) on the inside. It definitely appears to be well made (sturdy) and seriously protects the device. The device attaches to the case with two prongs that secure it in place. It is pretty easy to attach. The bottom of the case is open, so you can access the area for the charger easily. Thus, charging your Kindle while it is in the case.<br /><br />2.  The case (with the Kindle enclosed) is not heavy. You can comfortably fit in your purse, book bag; backpack or briefcase, and it won't weigh your bag down.<br /><br />3. There is a built in expanding (rubberband) type cord that is attached to the case that will allow you to either keep the case open or closed (as desired).<br /><br />4. The light conveniently rises out of the top right corner of the case. I will warn you that there were times when it seemed difficult to pull out. (Just be mindful that you don't force it, but instead pull the tab up by the indention provided.) However, once it is up, the built-in light does illuminate the screen (more than I ever thought it would) well. The light cuts on and off with the device, so there are no batteries. The light works off the charge of the Kindle, and you control when you use the light. (I also haven't found that the light drains the battery any quicker normal). The light gives just the right amount of illumination, and isn't so bright as that it will bother others sleeping in the same room. My husband always complained that when I would read at night, in bed, that the lamp (on my nightstand) was too bright and kept him from falling asleep. And when I used the traditional clip on book light when traveling in a car, he use to complain that my book light was too distracting. He actually doesn't seem to be distracted or bothered by this gem. Perhaps because it seems to be more defused or softer.<br /><br />In the end, I don't regret my purchase. I definitely got more than I had hoped and would definitely recommend this case. It is affordable and the benefits outweigh the cost. 5 stars!",

Therefore, he is comparing this controller to his white, wireless one.<br /><br />Appearance: This remote looks like the classic XBOX controller. It is black with the traditional analog joysticks, buttons and signature XBOX logo. And while there are a few new features (i.e., buttons), the overall look is the same. *NOTE: He feels that this controller is lighter (in terms of weight) than his other one, but attributes that to the fact that it’s wired versus wireless, which means rechargeable batteries. *The cord has a nice length (several feet) so you don’t have to worry about sitting super close when gaming. You can sit back, play XBOX and chill!<br /><br />New features: (1) You can control the volume of the mic from the controller. (2) You have the ability to reassign controls (rb/lb) using the rolling buttons located on the bottom. AND (3) You can change the color or design of the face of this controller.<br /><br />Versatile (computer or game system): You can use this controller on the PC or the XBOX 1. Simply plug it in.<br /><br />Now the cons: In the end, my son gave this remote only 4 stars. While he likes the cool new features (controlling the volume and assigning controls), he loves the versatility that the wireless one offers.  He said that when you compare the cost of the two devices (wired vs wireless), the difference is worth it to have the versatility and freedom of movement.",

We have both Xbox One and PS4. They are affordable, the setup is simple and they are easy to use. The (surround) sound quality is good. They are noise canceling, meaning you really can’t hear outside while gaming (but it probably helps that my sons listen to their games and music extra loud). You can control the volume by a slide control and you know you’ve muted when the orange light is on. The (aluminum) headband is comfortable and can be adjusted easily. The headset is light and can be stored anywhere. The only drawback is that these are not wireless, but the cord is long enough (3-4ft) to play without being too distracting. The cord is long enough to use while sitting at a desk, on a sofa or in a chair. You should not have any issues. And finally, the microphone does detach.

You can organize, charge and cool. The stand allows you to keep your device vertically while cooling with a fan! It is easy to assemble. The fan is pretty quiet and has 3 settings (low, medium and high). You can store up to 12 games/DVDs beside it and charge your controllers. Overall, he is extremely satisfied and gives it 5 stars.  **Note: I am going to have to order enough for my other son.",

                "text": "My husband and I were at a friend’s house (a few months ago) who owns a Meta Quest 2. He invited us to play and I noticed how much my husband enjoyed it. So, I decided this device would be the perfect gift for him, for Christmas. He seems to be really enjoying it and so do other members of the family!<br /><br />The set-up is simple. Once connected you are ready to begin downloading games. Some are free and some aren’t. You can even travel to different countries (which is cool), go on a safari,<br />mountain climb, play golf and so many other activities.  There are informative and interactive videos. The graphics are great and offers you a realistic view (360 degrees) of whatever you are looking at. There are also chat rooms (if you are interested in that type of thing), interactive and multi-player games (like Saber), and much more. Some of these games (like Saber) improve hand/eye coordination. It can be a family friendly game/environment.  The set comes with the headset, 2 controllers, and a storage bag/cover. It is lightweight and portable. It even comes with an adaptor for eyeglass wearers. Overall, while a little pricey, I think it is worth it (especially for a man who has everything).",

                "text": "The corsair virtuoso is a pretty good headset. I previously used my Void Pro SE, and draw most of my comparisons off that. I broke down my thoughts into few categories.<br /><br />Fit: The headset feels stiff and a little tight on the sides of my head. I prefer the fit of the void pro. I think I have a pretty medium sized head, and I felt a fair amount of clamping pressure on my ears. This also makes the headset feel lighter because there was less weight resting on the top of my head. I wish this were more adjustable because it's a little too tight.<br /><br />Sound: (tested in wired & wireless mode, and experienced similar results): Just to clarify, I am no audiophile and have not owned a high quality set of headphone, but the sound seems ordinary. I tried to give this a big sample of uses: thx intro video, streamed music, I still have some .wav files, and gamed a bit. The headset handled all of it, but in much the same way as my void pro.<br /><br />Mic: This was my favorite part of the headset. My experience with detachable my microphones has been less than stellar. Most of the time they look incredibly flimsy and generic. This mic matches the rest of the asthetics of the headset, and has sounded better and crisper than any mic I've tried. The mic is flexible, but I wish you could change the color of the mic LED. It is solid green when unmuted, and red when muted.<br /><br />Design, look, feel: very nice corsair style. Perforated side RGB is cool, ear pads are a nice cushy leathery feel. It feels like all the surfaced are metal, padding, or coated plastic to make it nice to touch. With the mic removed they look like a nice set of headphones.<br /><br />Other thoughts: I had some pains with the setup of these. They did not auto sync with corsair's icue software, and had a lot of crackling when used just with plug n play. I had to manually update the software and plug the headphones into the usb via cable. This fixed the sound issues, but the headset will sometimes not show up next to my other corsair devices in icue. This is frustrating, and I did not have these problems with my Void Pro.<br /><br />I feel like these are very nice for a normal gaming headset, but it doesn't seem to be worth more than $200.<br /><br />Hope this has been helpful:)",

                "text": "This headset is the best headset I've used to date. I used this exclusively for PC, and I moved to these from the Corsair Void Pro. These are much nicer quality, but it did have downsides.<br /><br />Sound - best sounding gaming headset that I've ever tried. It sounds super crisp and has plenty of bass.<br /><br />Mic - the recordings sounds pretty good for a headset, but nothing great.<br /><br />Fit & Feel - Fit is great, very comfortable. Feel is meh for a $300 headset, feels plasticy and adjusting the arms (which you have to shorten most of the way for it to fit into the charging dock) feels a little janky in the way that it moves slowly, but if i apply more pressure, then I might break the headset.<br /><br />Other notes: This is for XBox 1 and PC, but it feels like it was made more for the former, and merely is compatible with the latter. It has a volume toggle control on the side (as well as 4 other buttons, switches, and rollers) that is labelled \"Game\" on one side and \"Voice\" the other. I somehow triggered one of them that rendered me barely able to hear the audio even with my system maxxed, app volume at max, and even the headset volume roller (that for some reason does not control the system volume) at max. It made me wonder why I have 3 seperate volume controls, and then a 4th toggle that somehow also dramatically affects volume. It is because these were made with a console in mind (and it makes perfect sense for a console), but having that many additional buttons controlling just volume seems ridiculous when you have a mouse that can easily interact with volume sliders and a physical volume roller on my keyboard.",

Then it snowed for two days straight, but I didn't get any more snow cover. I wondered why. So I found an online animal crossing community and learned the awful truth: playing the game destroys the look of your town! What???<br /><br />Yep...all that wandering aimlessly lost I did in the beginning, racing around in hide-n-seek games, running to catch a present, and all the saves required by multiplayer gaming combined to turn my town into a virtual desert. I have probably made my last snowman. No snow also = no grass when summer comes as well.<br /><br />I am very sad. The grass/snow will regrow eventually, but it will take months if not years, and you can't walk on it AT ALL during the process. My other choice is to tear down my town and start over, reminding myself to walk around as little as possible and NEVER run. Not as much fun anymore. Or I can just resign myself to life in the desert. Animal Crosssing: Desert Dwellers. Yippee.<br /><br />Whatever, a lot of the lightheearted fun of it is gone for me now that I hesitate to walk in spots where there still IS some snow.  I don't wander around looking for fossils or shaking trees, and hide-n-seek is out of the question.  What is the purpose of planting and watering flowers and trees and pulling weeds if my town is still going to look like a dustbowl town when I'm done?<br /><br />Boo to Nintendo for not testing this \"feature\" fully before release and not fixing it when when it became a problem.

Thankfully I decided to put one on my own switch and then put a screen protector on hers rather than just give her the package. Because she’s never put a screen protector on anything and I know she would’ve had no idea how to do it.  There are no instructions whatsoever in the box. Many times manufactures just stick a piece of paper in there with a link to a YouTube video to explain how to do it, but there wasn’t anything like that either. I’ve done screensavers on phones and iPads and digital cameras and stuff before so I know how to do it. but not everybody does. Missing from the package were the positioning tapes that most glass screen savers use to make it easier to apply the screen in the correct place. I used washi tape I had laying around. Also, they had a little sticker that said some thing about this being the back. I pulled that little tiny sticker off and the protective film on the back did not come off. I stuck the little sticker to the box to get it out of my way and then realized that you were intended to stick it on another portion of the protective film on the back of the screen protector and then it would stick and you could remove it. I do not understand why they did that that way and with no instructions, you were left to figure it out for yourself. The screen protector itself is nice. Once I got it on I had no bubbles, I don’t even know it’s there, it doesn’t seem to interfere with the touchscreen, and it seems to be good quality. But the lack of instructions and other issues make me unable to recommend it.",

And when you're ready to use it, and it's done charging, you just pick the controller up and play. I wasn't able to time how long it took to charge, but it's average. There is a light indicator on the bottom of the charging system to let you know that the power is on. Overall, I would recommend. It's easy to use, doesn't take up a lot of space, and charges the controllers with no problems.",

You immediately become aware of just how much and how often your head moves.  This noise is horribly loud and annoying.  You can hear it even if the headset is not plugged into anything so this is a physical design issue.<br /><br />The headset seems to work all of 20-30 seconds when using Google Voice, which was the primary reason I got them.  Then it just simply cuts out speaker and microphone, EVERY SINGLE TIME!  Basically useless.<br /><br />It will however play music just fine.  I even tried playing music, then starting a call.  First it cut out the music, then the call, then a few seconds later the music cut back in.  That's reliability.<br /><br />So I decided to download their drivers rather than relying on Windows 8.1 drivers.  Their drivers made all sound on my laptop useless.  Gone is the smart switch from the headset to the laptop speakers when I unplug the headset or the other way around.  So is the builtin ability to have a default sound system for playing music and a default system for communications.<br /><br />Worst of all?  The drivers stop the ability to open Sound from Control Panel.  I rebooted, tried again, then went to uninstall their drivers/software.  Surprise, the Sound settings popped up on its own as soon as the it was uninstalled.  It was being held back by the software.  HORRIBLE programming.",

                "text": "I waited a long time to write this review.  Why?  Because I wanted to test this game out thoroughly.  Also, I wanted to play it just one more time before writing my review.<br /><br />Buzz Jr allows you to play in multiplayer mode- up to four players.  There are four buzz units which are connected at one point.  Anyone can enter information that will be recognized by the game.<br /><br />We played this across the room- about 8 ft from the PS3 and had plenty of room to move around without feeling restricted by the controller cords.<br /><br />You can also play singler player.<br /><br />There are practice options so you can learn the games.<br /><br />You can also save and load games, align the screen, and there is a widescreen option.  We played in widescreen mode.<br /><br />When you are ready to play you have the following options:<br />marathon<br />single player<br />short game<br />medium game<br />long game<br /><br />We played the short and medium so far as we did not want to be locked into anything long- everyone wanted a chance to win.<br /><br />To play a game you have the choice of quick start, standard, and custom games.  The nice part about custom games is that you can set up a list of games that you especially like and play them without having to suffer through games that you don't enjoy or that frustrate you.<br /><br />The list of games to choose from is this:<br />Totem Poles<br />Whack a Squirrel<br />Wheel Running<br />Balloon Battle<br />Bridge Out<br />Bubble Bath<br />Card Counting<br />Elephant Baseball<br />Free Fall<br />High Voltage Voting<br />Island War<br />Jungle Hurdles<br />Keep It Up<br />Leaping Lily Pads<br />Lion Taming<br />Monkey Bomb<br />Monkey Bingo<br />Monkey Catapault<br />Monkey Slide<br />Odd One Out<br />Primate Penalties<br />Rocket Riders<br />Run Around<br />Simian Shootout (not sure of that one- can not read my own writing!)<br />Splat<br /><br />WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS GAME<br /><br />There is so much that I can write about this game in the positive mode- it would take pages.<br /><br />For the first point, it is there is color- LOTS AND LOTS OF BRIGHT CHEERFUL COLOR!  That in itself makes the game enjoyable to play.<br /><br />We loved that you could personalize your monkey with crazy glasses, clothing, and feet, and the ability to name them is great too.<br /><br />The music is delightful and fun - very happy music but it does not get to you to hear it over and over like some games.<br /><br />The game controllers work beautifully.  They are very responsive and everyone had chances to win games.  The game is easy to use, and yet challenging enough for everyone that no one was bored.<br /><br />What I especially like about it is that the games were challenging without being insulting or off color in attitude.  There were a couple of crude things that some people might object to such as gorilla flatulence underwater and a few things like that, but on the whole it was really fun.<br /><br />ONE THING I DID NOT LIKE<br /><br />I did not like voltage voting, however, I thought that was in bad taste- that was the only game I recall being so irritated with that I refuse to play it- voting will electrocute a gorilla I think it is and it just seemed sadistic even cruel- and although it is just a cartoon, the attitude behind it upset me and I don't think it is family oriented.<br /><br />FINAL COMMENTS<br /><br />However, the rest of the games- and I think we have played all of them- are really fun and entertaining.  All of the games take different skills so each member of the family had a chance of winning.  That made it fun to keep going back to try playing over and over.  No one felt that they were not able to have a chance at winning.<br /><br />All in all this game is a huge winner- it gave the entire family a chance to play on Playstation without any concern for content and suitability for different family members.  Playing this game has been one of the highlights of the last few months.  Our son said it reminds him of Mario Party 3.",

                "text": "Because we like to try out electronic cables and devices for a while before drawing a conclusion, I have made sure to test out this cable for several months now.  The verdict is in- this cable is a very high quality cable which works beautifully with no problems at all.<br /><br />Despite it being thick and a little tricky since you can not bend it at a sharp angle, it is easy to work with by looping a bit as the 6+ft of cable gives us plenty of room to do so, but I would advise you to check out any holes in furniture or other small areas that the cords might have to pass through to be sure you have enough room to pass this cable through if there is any question- BEFORE you install it.<br /><br />We have checked this cable with various devices- PS3, HDTV, Blu-Ray player and most recently it is being used from a high quality amplifier to a very high level audio-visual computer system.  In all cases, the picture/sound has been top notch, with no disintegration of information flow or integrity of signal.<br /><br />The quality of this cable is definitely high and equals or surpasses the performance of cables that are much more expensive on the market but have brand names that people are more familiar with.  We have a LOT of cables and cords in our house as we have an electronic addict in our home, so we have a lot of HDMI cables and devices to test and compare with.  This cable is also a good choice for future equipment upgrading as it will be compatible.<br /><br />The frustration free packaging is brilliant, by the way.  Makes life a LOT easier!<br /><br />I highly recommend this cable, as long as you are not required to make a sharp angle for installation with no extra cord to loop around, or as long as your cable does not have to pass through a very tiny space (as is often the case when you have multiple cables running through holes in furniture, or other small spaces.",

It is THAT in depth.  His favorite are Turtle Beach.<br /><br />All three of us have tested these headphones.<br /><br />I think they are great for music and gaming.  I think they are pretty nice and I like using them.  They cancel noise outside well too.<br /><br />My daughter loves them when doing her school assignments because they cancel outside noise and it is hard to get her attention when she is using them for work online on our PC.  They are comfortable and she does not remember she has them on a lot of time.  She loves the extendable microphone but she wishes it was just a half inch longer or so.<br /><br />She likes all of the different extensions that come with it.  The cord seems to be a good length.  The only other thing she was not keen on was the plastic quality.<br /><br />My son's major comment about them is that often companies will sacrifice the midrange sounds in an effort to get the higher highs and lower bass sounds and he said that seems to be the case with these.<br /><br />For what they are, however, the three of us agree it is a decent buy and pretty good for use in games, school programs, and listening to music as well.<br /><br />We don't have an iphone to test it on so I can not comment on that application of it.",

                "title": "A Few Frustrations But Overall Great Gaming Experience So Far (And Some Things I Wish The Instructions Said)",
                "text": "My entire family is into gaming and other applications that use headphones and speakers, so I was very interested in try out the Siberia P800 series wireless gaming headphones.  There are a lot of excellent highly technical reviews out there for these, but I intend to approach these headphones for someone who is not as into gritty tech details as they might be into practical every day applications.<br /><br />I am writing this review for those who really want to know about products prior to purchase.  I am as detailed as I can be without being overly so, because I want to provide information that I would like to know before purchases.  This is an expensive purchase, so it deserves some explanation and time given to research.<br /><br />WHAT COMES IN THE BOX?<br />The box that these come in is excellent.  It is sturdy and you can keep it for storage of the extra cords and parts if you like.  Inside the headphones come carefully pressed into a molded insert.  It comes with a wireless transmitter box, every cord you might possibly want to connect it to the Playstation, PC,or Xbox.  It also comes with a mobile cable and analog cable for use with TV or mobile device.<br /><br />The startup guide is, well, let me say really not as good as it should be with an expensive set of headphones like this.  For visual learners, you might have some issues unless you are a real techie.  There are no pictures of the back of the transmitter box or of the back of the playstation (or other items) you want to connect to so if you are not really good at understanding what goes where, you might have to look up online somewhere how to hook this up to your console or other devices.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THE HEADPHONES LIKE?<br />The headphones themselves have a cushioned top and small ear covers on them.  The retract and get slightly bigger, but not a huge amount.  The top is cushioned and they hold onto the had pretty well, at times feel a bit tight.  That will loosen up over time, I am sure.<br /><br />The left ear pad has a retractable mic in it.  When the mic is turned on, a red ring lights up.  The disc on the outside of the left ear pad also twists off and that is there the lithium battery is put.  When you want to replace, you quickly twist off the cover, replace the battery and you are good to go.  There are two arrows that line up for you to replace the cover quickly so you don't have to fumble with it in a hurry to continue your game.<br /><br />The right ear side has the on off switch on it located just slightly toward the back of bottom of the circle.  If the ear pad was a clock with 12 at the top and 6 at the bottom and 9 toward your front with these on, it is about at 5 o'clock.  To turn it on, you press for about a minute or so.  The switch will light up.  If you want to turn on the mic, you tap the same switch once and the mic goes on.  Tap again and it goes off.<br /><br />On the right ear side, there is also a control.  It is a wheel which controls volume, but when pressing it, will change the menu on the transmitter box.  Then if you move the wheel it will scroll the menu.<br /><br />The ear pads do fold flat which makes them a bit easier to store when not in use.<br /><br />I also find that the longer I use these, the more comfortable they seem to become- I imagine they will continue to loosen up over time.<br /><br />HOW DOES THE TRANSMITTER BOX WORK?<br />I tested these headphones out on a PS3.  I found very little on the internet about using these headphones with a PS3, so knowing that many still use the PS3, I wanted to test using that gaming console first.<br /><br />SET UP WITH PS3<br />Optical cable- plug in to optical out on PS3 in back then plug into optical in on the back of the transmitter box.<br />USB- plug in mini USB side of the cable to the transmitter box and plug the regular USB side into the front of the PS3<br /><br />POWER - this is optional.  The power plug can be plugged in where it says DC but keep in mind that means the transmitter box will be on at all times.  If you prefer that it turns off when your PS3 is off, then don't use it.  The advantage of the power plug is if you want your battery to charge up when the unit is not on, you can have it plugged in for that. Once done, you can still remove the power plug until needed again.<br /><br />SIDE SLOT<br />This package comes with an additional battery.  One battery had a single bar of charge on it and the other had two bars of charge on it.  So, while using on, the other is charging in the box.  I found that with the power plugged in, it took about 45 minutes to reach a full charge or so.  One battery took almost an hour.  The battery pushes in and locks into place while charging, and then if you push on it again, it will dislodge and come out so you can use it and replace with the other one if you like.<br /><br />FRONT PANEL<br />The front panel has a white light up design.  It shows the battery charge, that the headphones are on and if you are using gaming and voice and the balance of the two.  There is a dial on the right and a back button to the left of that.  When turning on the headphones, I get a light that shows they are on then a quick large display of battery power left in them, and then it goes to the screen that shows me PS3 and how much volume is being used at that point.  It will also show me the current battery charge of the battery that is charging on the side of the unit too so I can keep track of when it is ready to use should I need it.<br /><br />The menu is pretty simple to adjust.  You press the button to change menu and turn the dial to run through it.  There are presets for equalizer and you can also set custom.<br /><br />WHAT THE DON'T SAY IN THE INSTRUCTIONS<br />Call me dumb if you want, but although I have programmed computers and done a lot of technical work, I guess I was having a dull moment when I set up these headphones.  I could not get them to work.  I went through every setting over and over again and just could not make them work right.<br /><br />Since I have never had headphones on my PS3, (I am the only one who hasn't) I did not realize that I had to change the settings in the sound menu.  I should have, but I didn't remember.  So, after much looking around, I finally found the setting that has to be changed.  There is no mention of it at all in the instruction book.  Since this review is geared more toward the casual gamer, I thought you might like to know that small important fact.<br /><br />You have to go into the PS3 settings menu for sound and pick either the optical sound or you can have both going if you like- through the TV AND headphones.  I like to do that when the family wants to be in the room and see what is being played but I want to hear details of sound you normally don't catch on just the TV speakers.  You just have to remember to change the settings when you change how you prefer to transmit the sound.<br /><br />HOW WELL DO THESE HEADPHONES PERFORM?<br />I am going to have to really work with these for a while to find the ins and outs of them.  My first impression of them was awful.  I really was disappointed.  There was hissing, crackling and all sorts of noise with sound effects on various games.  The music seemed fine, but every time there was an explosion or some sort of noise that was supposed to be electronic in nature, the headphones had so much other noise in them it was distracting and annoying.  I messed with volume and settings and everything and it just didn't get as good as I thought it should have.<br /><br />I kept on, however, changing to various games.  As I moved through all sorts of different games, I realized that some games must be designed with engines that do not seem to transmit clearly over the wireless headphones.  They just are awful.  Then other games seemed to be clear and a lot easier to play.<br /><br />DOLBY<br />So far, I have had the best results when removing Dolby on all of the games I have tried.  I am not sure if that is because the headphones are designed for 7.1 and the PS3 is designed for 5.1, but it seems to be more muffled with the Dolby on and there are more annoying features that come up with sound effects.  I will continue to play with this and see how to make it work if I can.  I will update this review at that point.  We have several different gaming consoles we can try these with, so over time I will elaborate if I find solutions or differences.  The listing on these headphones does specify that it will work on both PS3 and PS4 so I plan to see what I can find out about this over time.<br /><br />MUSIC<br />I have watched videos on these headphones and found them to be excellent.  I can hear all sorts of nuances that I did not catch on just the TV speaker.  I watched them via Netflix and also Bluray on the PS3.  Sound was much better than some games.  Like I said, however, it could just be the software used when developing some games that does not translate as well into the headphones as others.<br /><br />I do want to point out, that these are GAMING headphones.  They are not going to be the top of the line for music listening, so if that is primarily what you want them for, they probably will not be what you want.  For the variety of needs I have on the PS3 of videos to music in games and movies, they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />MICROPHONE<br />I have not had the opportunity to test out the mic yet with other players.  I will update as that opportunity presents itself and will comment on performance during gameplay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />So far I really like these headphones but have a few issues with them.  Some games do not sound right in these at all, and others sound beautiful.  That is not always the fault of the headphones, but it does make for annoying experiences in some games.  The design of the headphones is nice and I do love how they work when they work well with games.  The transmitter is easy to use and battery life seems a bit shorter than 20 hours, but I like the fact that you can keep a battery charging while playing so when you need to replace you can.<br /><br />I also like that you can opt to have the power on to them while the PS3 is off so you can recharge battery, but then unplug it so that it only turns on when the PS3 is on too.<br /><br />For the price, I have rated these four stars at this time.  As I continue to use them and learn more about them and the ins and outs over time, I will update and amend my rating if need be.<br /><br />FUTURE UPDATES<br />I plan to test these out with other games as well on my PC games as well as tablet in the future and will comment on those experiences as well.<br /><br />GAMES TESTED SO FAR  (more coming soon)<br />Monkey Island (newest one)<br />Hydrophobia<br />Zen Pinball<br />Peggle<br />Planet Minigolf<br />Spellunker HD<br />Beyond Two Souls",

                "text": "When it comes to headphones, my family is a bit obsessed.  There are always plenty of opinions and preferences flying around our house, so when I had the chance to test these out, there was a grabbing contest and then we had a winner!  Let's see how these rated with our headphone fan.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE HEADPHONES LIKE?<br />A full set of headphones, these are meant to be full coverage.  There is plenty of padding on the top of the headphones and in the ears as well.  There is a wheel volume control on the left side.  There is a flip down mic that flips up when you don't need it.  There is also a button on the left side that turns the mic on and off.  There is not any light indicator to show if they are on or off.<br /><br />The mic comes with a foam head that you can apply if you need to.  There is a regular plug for a tablet but if you want to use it on the computer, the adaptor allows me to plug into the computer via USB.  There is a dolby option for surround sound that seems to be only for the computer.  If you want to use this with Xbox One, you need to purchase an adapter<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />I am going to break down what areas that this has performance in.<br /><br />GENERAL SOUND<br />Just by itself on a tablet or phone, this is okay.  It is not overly impressive, but still works well enough to be worth using.  Later on in this review, we will explore the sound after the software engine was used on the computer.<br /><br />CORD<br />The cord is a little over 6 ft long which is plenty long enough for comfortable moving around while listening.<br /><br />COMFORT<br />These headphones are really comfortable.  The cushioning is great and allows for many hours of use without any problems.  The swivel of the ear pieces is fabulous.  The set up is wonderful.  These headphones excel in comfort and the way that the parts work as far as wear on the head goes and operation of the mic and such.  The foam on the ears and top of head is cooler to wear than leather or synthetic leather as it breathes nicely.<br /><br />CONTROLS<br />You can use volume on the headphones but also the base unit you are using it from.  The controls are handy, so you don't have to be bound to use only the base controls from what unit you are using.  The mic button is handy and much nicer than a wheel control.<br /><br />MIC<br />Calls were heard fine and so far the mic seems to be good to use - people can hear well and it is clear.  Used with voice activated systems it worked very well.  When used with the foam cover it seems to block outside noise well.<br /><br />DOLBY<br />It makes it sound like you are in a tin can.  It just is not that great.<br /><br />DRIVERS<br />The best performance from these headphones is using the Conair Utility Engine (CUE).  That is only available through the computer use.  It is really a nice separation of sounds, base is excellent, and the allowance for custom settings is great.  This satisfied everyone and they really liked these better once this program was used.<br /><br />Gaming was greatly improved using this engine.  It is great surround sound using computer games which is what this was designed to be used for.<br /><br />CONTRAST EXPERIMENT<br />We tested out the same song recording on a phone, tablet, and then on the computer.  The sound difference was worth mentioning.  When listening on the tablet and phone, the sound was muffled and there was not a great separation of sound.  It was adequate but nothing to write home about.  When listening to the same song on the laptop using the Corsair Utility Engine it was like a very different set of headphones.<br /><br />COMMENTS<br />Is this a jaw dropping set of headphones?  No.  Is it a great set of headphones to game with and enjoy when you want a decent set that is comfortable, but if you are very picky about your headphones and are fanatical about sound separation and definition (aka realism) this is probably not the headset for you.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This set of headphones is a good starting set of gaming headphones.  VERY comfortable to wear for long periods, the mic on these is good and works clear enough to be heard and operate voice activated software well.  Separation is best using computers with the Corsair Utility Engine, but is adequate for tablets and phones if you just want to hear music or something without anyone hearing you.  These are not top of the line, but they are a hit with our daughter who uses them constantly for everything from phone and tablet, to gaming and voice activated lessons.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Despite them not being top of the line, our daughter really likes these.  We all feel that they are one of the most comfortable headsets we have ever used and they serve us well for her basic needs.  As for five stars, I would say four is more accurate.  The rating is more like FOUR AND A HALF STARS",

Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />I have to say, I was a bit confused when I first saw the photos of this.  It looked like it has all of these fancy designs on the pad.  In reality, it is just the edging that changes, that is all.  It is still cool though.  This fits across the entire slide out ledge for my keyboard and mouse.  It is plenty large enough for both and then some room too.<br /><br />LIGHTS?<br />The edge is what lights up.  This either is a static color, a slow fading from one color to another, or a combination of two colors fading on each corner of the edging.  It is fun to have and really does look cool when gaming or using the computer in a darkened room.  It also has a low and high setting.  The high setting supplies just enough light for a darkened room to help see a bit better.<br /><br />CORD<br />The cord that comes with this was a bit too short for my set up.  I have it on the slide out shelf which the keyboard rests on.  The plug in for the mat is at the front edge, but it has to double back to the computer USB connection and not get in the way of the shelf sliding in an out.  I had to get a longer cord for this as the cord that came with the unit was not quite long enough.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE?<br />This performs very well as a mousepad both as gaming or every day use.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a great addition to a keyboard/mouse area that covers the entire pull out shelf of a computer desk, this pad is fun to have.  It is not hard to use, but I did need a longer cord to make it work for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Despite needing a longer cord, I am giving this five stars.  I like it.

It can be programmed to coordinate with the Alienware laptop and in individual games via the Alien Command Center.<br /><br />CUSTOMIZABLE DPI<br />You can customize the DPI on this through the alien command center.<br /><br />SCROLL WHEEL<br />The scroll wheel has worked well for the internet and pages we need to use it for.  It has been pretty accurate without any frustrations so far.<br /><br />BUTTONS<br />Most of the buttons have a basic set up which you can find online, but you can program the buttons too.  It takes some work to be able to program them as there is a bit of a learning curve on this mouse.  We have had some issues with the Alien Command Center being complete for some things.  This mouse is one of them.  It could be from our original problems with the laptop and trying to re-download everything.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />The mouse is nice and robust.  The textured raised pattern makes it really easy to move it back and forth without slipping.  This performs like expected for gaming.  There is no lagging in tracking and it will work on almost any surface.  The basic programming we have done has worked so far.  We have not done anything intense or complex with it yet.  We just use it as a mouse that lights up.<br /><br />PAD FOR THUMB REST<br />The pad for the thumb to rest gives you dependable grip and helps you keep track of your thumb while gaming so you are not pressing buttons.  There are three buttons above the thumb rest.<br /><br />CORD<br />This has a mesh covering on the cord which allows the cord to move and keeps it from catching on surfaces or tangling when you are winding or using it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you happen to have an Alienware laptop (in our experience the M17 R2) this mouse is a great companion.  I has extra abilities to be programmed in sync with lights on the laptop as well as setting features through the Command center.  The cord is tangle free and really nice to use.  The mouse works very well so far on a number of surfaces.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This has more potential than we have learned yet.  We have had to spend so much time trying to get the laptop straightened out after an initial period of frustration that we have not had as much time to explore all of the dimensions of the mouse.  So far, it is really nice and it has worked well for what we have programmed it to do in games and other applications.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I will update this in the future if we discover any more to add to this review.",

                "title": "My Headphone Fanatic VERY PICKY Kids Love These",
                "text": "I originally got these headphones with the thought that I could play my playstation with them.  Unfortunately, I forgot that you can not use headphones with a PS3.  So, my kids got to try these. Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These headphones are really nicely designed.  My daughter said they are brilliantly designed.  The top that goes on top of your head is very stretchy and the wire part about it is one position.<br /><br />MICROPHONE<br />The microphone is not retractable, but folds out of place if you want it to.  It lights up when it is in use, and when it is disabled, it is not lit.  The mic is clear and very loud. It is easy to control.<br /><br />EARPHONE PADS<br />The pads are very comfortable and cushioned well.  We can wear these a while before they have to be taken off.  It is quite comfortable to all of us who tried these on.  They are not leather, so if you have sweaty ears, you might have to remove them for a bit now and then.<br /><br />CONTROLS<br />The controls on the left ear are all in the back.  They are difficult to control unless I take off the headset.  However, one of the kids has no problem doing it with them on.  I guess it depends but either way, it is not difficult.<br /><br />CORD<br />The cord is only about 6ft long which means you can not sit very far away from your PC or gaming machine, unless you have an extension you can add to it, which I suggest you get prior to purchase.<br /><br />LIGHTS<br />The lights on these are really cool.  They are colorful and can be turned off if you want.  If you have a keyboard or gaming pad that has lights on it, these will go well with them.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />When used with PC games, the sound quality of these is really nice.  The kids love the sound, nice base, vibration is decent, and the separation of the sounds is great.  Even without the drivers installed, it worked really well.  My kids are VERY critical and picky, so for them to rave about these is significant.<br /><br />DOES THIS WORK WITH PS3?<br />If you have a lot of USB ports on your TV you might be able to use these with your PS3 through the TV but not use the mic as that has to be put in a different way.  If not, then it won't work with the PS3 although you can use the mic, just not hear the sound effects through the headphones.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These headphones are excellent for PC gaming and if you can get them to work with PS3 or PS4.  The sound separation is great, the 3D is nice and even without the drivers on the CDROM included, the headphones work well.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  For the price, these have been a surprise for our family.  The PC gaming is really nice with them, and if I can get my PS3 hooked up to a TV with USB ports, perhaps I can make it work for that in the future.  For now, I am content to play PC games with these, if I can get them away from the kids, that is.",

I bought them a while back when they were on sale and haven't regretted my purchase on bit. I know there are better headsets out there but for the money, these are a win for me. They do what I need and being bald, they are quite comfortable for many hours of use. Other headsets tend to get uncomfortable and hurt the top of my head after only a short while. Also, I wear glasses and was worried that these would get uncomfortable because of that however I've got no complaints. Totally would recommend these to anyone looking for a solid headset.",

As I noted in the headline here, after about 30 minutes of wearing them during some gaming sessions they started to feel like they were squeezing my ears a bit. Sound quality was great and the microphone worked almost better than a more expensive set that I own. The inline mic control works as it should and I like the volume control that's located on the left ear piece. They are easy to adjust to fit my medium sized head comfortably. The mic is removable and once inserted it's a little tricky to get it back out and when doing so, I broke a little plastic tab off the mic where it locks into place. the mic still works however, and seems to still stay in place anyway. There is also an included plug that fits into the headphone jack when not using the mic.",

The new Synapse app has been updated and much less buggy than when I last used it which was nice. The keys on this keyboard are nice and clicky (Razer Mechanical Switches) yet feel solid and not mushy. I love how customizable this keyboard is with the Synapse app. Color options are endless and you could spend hours personalizing every key with a different color if you wanted to. Personally I just like the presets that are available to tweak to your liking. Through the Synapse app you can also create Macros to your hearts content, however my Macro days have long since passed. It's even got on-board and cloud memory for your favorite programmed presets. If only this new version BlackWidow would have been available back in my WoW days! Seriously though, 5 stars all around!!",

I used to game pretty hard core back in the day and my favorite mouse back then was one of the higher end Razer mice which was a bit bigger and more involved to use. This new Razer Basilisk Essential Gaming Mouse was a breeze to set up and is the perfect size and has everything I need and more. For the little PC gaming I do now the Basilisk has plenty Macro options and I love the Chroma effects which sync perfectly with my Razer keyboard. The slightly textured rubber grips actually give me better control than I initially thought they would. The buttons are nice and clicky and feel like they will hold up to some heavy smashing. It glides super smooth which is due to the butter smooth pads, weight and the perfect soft flexible cord.",

I'm not only impressed by that, but the material quality of these is quite impressive as well and the foam ear pads (and head cushion) are very comfortable.

The mic does very well (but needs to be fully extended) and I never had any complaints from any friends while chatting via X-Box games. The only issue I felt there was with the headphones was that they didn't fit as snug as I prefer, which made them lack on sound isolation.",

The weight, shape and feel of this mouse fits my hand perfectly and is very comfortable to use and control. The RGB lighting is amazing and the Lenovo Legion App makes it so easy to configure not only the lighting, but for fine tuning and setting up profiles for the mouse. I have been using the M500 now for a few weeks and I absolutely love it.

                "text": "I ordered the ‘HyperX Cloud Stinger Wireless Gaming Headset with Long Lasting Battery Up to 17 Hours of Use, Immersive in-Game Audio, Noise Cancelling Microphone, Comfortable Memory Foam, and Designed for PC’ to use mostly for video editing and listening to music on PC. I would like to share my thoughts after quite some time using these headphones thus far, but first I would like to say that I am a big fan of HyperX and the quality products they produce.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Comfort - My initial impression was how light these headphones are and expected them to be extremely comfortable, however after about an hour into wearing them I noticed that the head padding just doesn't work for me. I have a bald head and find that many headphones just don’t have either the right amount of padding, or use a “not so comfortable” material. I much prefer my wired HyperX headphones for comfort.<br /><br />Sound - Although the sound quality is good, I expected it to be much better. For me there just isn’t enough Bass nor Volume to these Cloud Stingers. Don’t get me wrong here. The sound is nice, clear and not muddy but I really think that my wired HyperX cloud headphones sound much better.<br /><br />Frame - The Steel Slider frame is nice and light however the slider is a bit loose and tends to adjust too easily which gets annoying when you find just the right fit (btw they fit big in my opinion).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Swivel Earcups - I absolutely love the Swivel Earcups which make it easy to turn the earcup away from your ear so that you can listen to someone talking to you in the same room without having the headphones slide off you head. I wish my other headphones had this feature.<br /><br />Sound - I may have expected better sound quality however as I stated in the cons, but they do actually sound good and are very clear.<br /><br />Earcup Padding - I have no issues at all with the comfort of the Earcups nor padding. In fact they are very comfortable, just as my other HyperX headphones.<br /><br />Wireless Connection - The 2.4Ghz Wireless Connection has exceeded my expectations and works much better than Bluetooth in my opinion. I can walk into the next room without any loss in sound quality or losing connection.<br /><br />Battery Life - I have not fully tested how long the battery “actually” lasts but it does last a long time. I don’t charge them after every use but I will say that I have used them for hours at a time, then turned them off and came back days later to find them still capable of several more hours of use with zero issues.<br /><br />Volume Control - Though the Cloud Stingers don’t have the volume level that I expected, I do like that the volume control is nice in the sense that you can “fine tune” the volume level. By that I mean, as you slide the volume control it doesn’t jump up or down super fast as most do. As you rotate the volume control, it’s very gradual. The control doesn’t stop either way you rotate it. To adjust the volume you need to rotate it several times to go all the way up or down and the tension is absolutely perfect. This makes it nice so that if it slightly gets bumped by just putting the headphones on or taking them off (or rubbing against your hoodie) you’re not going to suddenly change the volume by much at all. I appreciate this feature probably most of all!<br /><br />Other Thoughts - The Swivel Mic does seem to work well the few times I have actually used it however I kind of wish that it was removable. The USB Dongle is nice and small however I have to admit that I have lost it a few times. I have recently however found a solution to this problem by placing the Dongle flat inside the earcup and twisting it slightly to fit snug and secure (see attached images)<br />Overall I am a fan of HyperX products and do feel there is definitely value to the Cloud Stingers and I do plan to continue to use them for video editing. However, I think there are better “wireless” headphone options for gaming and listening to music, but you will spend considerably more for those options.",

                "text": "I ordered the  'ASTRO Gaming A20 Wireless Headset, Black/Green - Xbox One' to use as my main X-Box One gaming headset and because Astro is such a great brand. Now that I have had plenty of time to use and play with the headset I am ready to share my thoughts.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1 - This headset sounds great for gaming and for music both on Xbox One and PC. They are nice and clear and quite satisfying.<br />2 - I find that even after a few hours of wearing they are still comfortable and do not irritate my ears, nor my bald head which is impressive, as I have tried others that tend to either cause my ears to feel as if they are being squished and or irritate the top of my head. This set is nicely padded both with the ear cups and headband.<br />3 - The Mic performs better than most and I find that compared to others that I have tried and tested, the Mic performance is probably the top of my list out of all that I own.<br />4 - I have had zero issues with this headset connecting and pairing up (quickly) with the control module, both when connected to the Xbox One or PC.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 - Seeing as this was going to be my main Xbox One gaming headset, I was extremely disappointed that it would not connect to the Xbox One Astro Command Center App. I tried several things and eventually contacted Astro Customer Support. They were quick to respond stating that the A20’s were not compatible with the Xbox One Astro Command Center (ACC) and could not tell me why. They stated that even if they knew why, that they probably wouldn’t be able to tell me. This is my main gripe and why I docked one star. I mean, it makes Zero sense to me that if the A20’s are made and designed for the Xbox One and PC then why should I also need a PC to connect to the ACC to make adjustments to the EQ settings and update firmware. Fortunately, I do have a PC and was able to do this, but for those that don’t, good luck.<br />2 - The placement of the volume control makes it so that if you are wearing a hoodie, and because the volume control is easily adjustable, it can easily be adjusted just by moving your head. Now with that said, it’s not a huge deal because fortunately it adjusts in very small increments but it is still a bit annoying. Also the A20’s don’t remember the last volume setting and every time you turn them on you need to adjust the volume, which for me means rotating the control up several times to get max volume.<br />3- I wish that the Mic was removable. Now this isn’t huge as it is nice to just be able to rotate the Mic down and it’s on, and rotate is back up and it’s muted but it would be nice to be able to remove it if you wanted.<br />4 - lastly I don’t like the overall look of this headset. I was concerned that because of the “square” boxiness look, that it wouldn’t fit right but as I stated in the Pro’s, this set is perfectly comfortable and because of that, I will give them kudos - but  they do look a bit funky compared to other brands and styles out there.<br />Overall and even with the listed Cons, I love this headset and think that Astro has produced a fantastic headset at a great value for the money but again, it makes no sense that it doesn’t work with the Xbox One ACC App.",

My first impression when I opened this G815 was that it screamed Quality and it's absolutely gorgeous! It's solid and heavy for a keyboard of this size and I couldn't wait to get it hooked up and install the  Logitech G Hub software. I am not so much into PC gaming as I once was, so I won't be able to really put this \"Gaming Keyboard\" through its paces in that sense, but I will tell you this, I absolutely LOVE the ever so smooth \"clicky\" mechanical keys. They aren't as loud and annoying as other keyboards I have owned. The keys are (IMO) perfect. Clicky yet not loud and they are very responsive. Not only that, but there is very little throw to them. I would almost go as far to say that they are a \"buttery smooth clicky\", if there is a such thing. Seriously though, the G815 has now bumped my other favorite keyboard off my desk, and it has now become my favorite keyboard of all time. I also love the lower profile and the RGB lighting effects are super cool and it's been fun customizing them via the G Hub software but honestly I just stick with the default presets and animations. I mean you can really go to town on customization if you want, and it can be a bit overwhelming. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the volume control and buttons for your media is very nice too. The wide volume roller bar is pretty sensitive, but the placement is easily accessible, yet not so much that you will accidentally bump it during normal use.<br />Overall, I think if you are looking for a solid quality keyboard at a great value, you should most definitely check this one out!",

My first impressions were that this was a really nice built keyboard but after playing with it a bit I found that I do not particularly like the feel of the keys. They are not really clicky (but loud), and the keys seem to have a fairly long thrown to them. They are quite sensitive, but to me they feel like you really need to press them all the way to ensure that they are being registered. It's not the case, as it doesn't take much pressure but it just feels like you need to press hard because of the long throw they seem to have. Another thing that I don't really like is the media control buttons. Personally I prefer a dial or knob rather than buttons for this feature. Overall I am happy with the build quality but I feel that for what you get, it is retailed a bit steep.

This Roccat Kain 200 is definitely a great build quality and I do love the wireless connection and have had zero issues with that. I love the little included cable adapter which allows you to plug into the back of your PC with the included cable, then bring it closer near the mouse, then plug the wireless USB adapter into the cable adapter (see attached images). The mouse is nice and performs well and I actually like the button that allows you to (on the fly) adjust the DPI. Most of the others out there you can adjust the DPI, but you are required to open the associated app and find the setting from within there to make the adjustments. The scroll wheel on the Kain 200 is a little on the tight side but with that said, it does make it less likely that you will scroll to quickly as others on the market tend to do. The scroll wheel also has a nice rubber feel with that satisfying sort of smooth clickyness. It just feels good. Again, build quality on this guy is great but the overall look and feel is just sort of plain to me. Some might like this but for me personally, I like a more ergonomically designed mouse. Plus I like more grip. The design of the Kain 200 has a smooth finish and not much grip. Overall I do believe there is a market for this mouse and many people will love the simple design but for me, I will be moving back to my favorite gaming mouse.",

                "text": "I ordered the 'PDP Xbox One MARS Starter Pack - Voyage of the Dead, 048-132-NA' for review. I was curious about this latest take on the arcade style lightgun and I feel that MARS has done a great job at their design however there is one thing I'd like to see improved. Before I explain that, I'd like to share my overall thoughts. First I would like to state that I had absolutely zero issues with setting this up on my Xbox One S. I was leary because so many others had issues with calibrating the camera. I set mine up in a mid sized living room about 8 feet from our old 55 inch plasma TV and for me, the set up and calibration was a breeze. There are many different games you can play besides the main Voyage of the Dead game. It totally reminds me of the old Duck Hunt from back in my day. All of the games are fun to play but I do wish it would have come with two guns. It would have been a more \"complete\" kit in my opinion. With all that said, the real issue I noticed is that although the gun is quite accurate, there is a bit of lag. This tends to get a bit annoying but it just takes some getting used to. I would hope that eventually this could be improved. Other than that, I think MARS has done a great job on this product and I look forward to more from them in future games.",

I am more used to the feel of a fabric top that is padded. I am not sure how they could have used this type of material with the wireless charger so I understand the material choice, but I really am not sold on the overall design.<br /><br />There are small very thin rubber pads on the bottom of the pad that are supposed to keep the pad in place, however even on a flat glass table top, it does not grip enough and tends to move around while using the mousepad. I have attached a bit of video that demonstrates this a bit as well as the wireless charging. Speaking of wireless charging, it does work but it does take some getting used to where your mobile device needs to be placed. When you find that sweet-spot, it does work but it does not Fast Charge unfortunately. This may be due to my 5 year old computer and my USB 3.0 ports may not provide the power to do so.<br /><br />There is also a fingerprint touch button at the top middle of the pad where you can touch to change the color options and this is fun to play with however I have noticed that while playing, the button is easily “accidentally” touched, which messes up your color choice. It’s not a big deal but it does get annoying if you have a certain option that you like and need to press through the options to find the one you prefer.<br /><br />Overall my thoughts are that this is a pretty nice mousepad and does have value however it’s not my favorite design. I do appreciate the wireless charging capability and it makes for a convenient way to keep your phone close while gaming and have it charge.",

This Tilted Nation stand has everything that I was looking for. It's sturdy and looks really nice on my desk. The RGB lighting is pretty sweet and the color options are nice and work well, although I have had one time where the lights shut off and I had to unplug the device then plug it bag in to get the lighting back on. I am not sure what happened but since then it has worked fine. I love the fact that I can also use the base to plug in a couple other USB 3.0 devices such as my RGB mouse-pad and even an SD card reader. Another great feature is the flexible mouse cable arm that keeps my mouse cable from getting snagged. I have never used anything like this before and I must say that it is pretty nice!

I used to be a die hard unmentioned brand fan boy at one time, but I have found that there are many others that have risen to compete against the best. HyperX happens to be one of those. I have a few other products from them that have blown me away in performance and quality. This Pulsefire Raid is most definitely my favorite at the moment. These days I mostly use a good mouse for video and photography editing and though I don't game much anymore, I would rather use a gaming mouse over a standard boring mouse. The Pulsefire Raid is anything but boring. It feels good in the hand and with the responsive clicky buttons, it makes for a better editing experience. I love that I can still take advantage of the programmable buttons as shortcuts within my editing software. It has become my new obsession to find the most useful and time saving shortcuts to map to my mouse. The Pulsefire Raid makes this so easy and I couldn't be happier with the overall performance. The customize-able lighting is fun to play with and that lighted logo is just so sick looking. Plus I love how smoothly it glides across my mouse pad. HyperX really nailed it with this one and I think it'll be a long while before I find another gaming mouse that I like better. I hope that this was helpful!",

This Razer Basilisk v2 has become my new favorite \"wired\" mouse to date. I use it mainly for PC use as well as video and photo editing, and it has performed flawlessly. I think my favorite feature is how comfortable it is. The ergonomic design and the way my thumb rests on the mouse rather than dragging on the mouse pad really makes this mouse enjoyable to use. It is also has a nice grip to it which really ads to the comfort and control. I also love the included optional thumb button that magnetically snaps into place and can be macro'd to commonly used Photo and video editing keys. The mouse glides smoothly across any surface and all the buttons are nice and clicky. Razer makes a great mouse and they are always innovating and creating better and better peripherals. Overall this really has become my favorite mouse to use, and I have to say that for a wired mouse, it is the most comfortable and reliable. I hope that this was helpful.",

First I would like to mention that I had originally ordered these in White. The box I received was tagged as white however it was mis-tagged and the headphones are black. This was not a huge deal to me but you may want to make sure you get the color you order before you open the box.<br /><br />I have had these for a while now and I must say that I am a Corsair fan but these are just a bit of a disappointment actually. The build quality is great, the sound is pretty good but the issue for me is the random static or lag that these have with my fresh install of Windows 10 Pro. I don't own a PS4 to test them on unfortunately so this review is entirely based on how they have performed on my PC.  They do connect super fast and effortlessly to my system, they feel comfortable but they are a bit on the large side for my head. The feel just a tad bit loose. I think the static or lag issue may be due to that these run off of the 2.4ghz bandwidth and I am using them in the same room as my wireless router which may be the issue but even so they should (in my opinion) be flawless in this situation. I can't say that I don't like these, but I can say that they are not my favorite. The RGB lights on the side are pretty cool but my guess is that they can and will drain the battery faster. As for the sound quality, they really hit the Bass, Mids and Highs spot on. The battery life is actually great for  Wireless gaming headphones and they seem to charge fairly fast although I have not completely drained the battery yet. As for the charging, I do have to point out that they charge via Micro USB which is another disappointment. It's 2020 Corsair and USB C should be the standard in my opinion. Overall I do like this headset, but it will be more of a backup to others that I have that I think are much better for the price. I hope that this was helpful.",

First, we had to take the silicone covers off and the little square Wii motion sensitivity sensors on the bottom to get these to recharge.  This was a really big pain and I was afraid I we were going to lose the accessories.  The remotes are a little wobbly in the charging station and you have to make sure the wrist strap fits in the little notch in the back to make them a bit more secure.<br /><br />The other thing that drove us a bit crazy was the fact that it was a USB attachment into the Wii station instead of using its own power cord.  So, it was always glowing right in front of the TV.  If your Wii is turned off, then it will not charge the remotes.  It has to be at least turned on (green light showing on Wii) or in the standby (yellow light showing on the Wii) position.<br /><br />We have always just used batteries, so we were hopeful this charging station would work well.  However, I think we will go back to using our regular batteries.  Maybe if we were true gamers and played all the time, I would think twice, but right now we only replace the batteries in the four chargers ever couple of months and maybe only play the Wii a couple times during the week.",

If you're trying to decide whether to pay for an upgrade, it depends on how irritated you get with the limitations of the ribbon in the 2007 version.<br /><br />For users in a business setting, some of the collaboration features (using Sharepoint Server) might also be of interest.

And that is a useful & long-desired improvement.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Intuit did its usual half-hearted, half-designed job with this feature, and it's quite disappointing:<br />1.  You can't sync investment accounts.  The old investing.quicken.com site is very limited, not worth using.  (For example, you can't see simple consolidated views of your investments, can't run basic reports. etc.)<br />2.  The sync from the desktop isn't automatic, and takes a long time.  If you're used to other online products that sync to the desktop (think Dropbox & Google Drive as two very popular examples, there are many others), you will find this clunky & old-tech.  Everytime you open Quicken, it will tell you you made changes, whether you did or not, and suggest that you sync.  This should be an automated, behind the scenes process, it's not hard.<br />3.  The alerts are rather dumb, and they're essentially hard-coded.  You can't create your own rules, and you can't even do a lot with the built-in rules (you can just pick some parameters from a limited list).  You can't delete them all either, if you consider them dumb and pointless.  Again, not hard to do a lot better.<br /><br />There are no significant improvements in reporting, or in investment analysis.  If you look at the \"What's new in 2013\" page, you see mobile, alerts, and \"more flexible budgeting\", whatever that means.<br /><br />There is a tweak to how accounts show up in the nav bar, where you can put some accounts in the \"Separate\" list, which means \"show but don't include with main set of accounts\".  This is mildly useful.  There's also a feature to mark an account \"closed\", also slightly useful -- in theory.  These account still show up in the list of accounts when you're doing a transfer between investment accounts!  Clearly someone forgot what the word \"closed\" might mean.<br /><br />So all in all, same old Intuit, same old Quicken.  Buy it if the mobile feature is useful to you.  (BTW, I tried Mint as an alternative, and I couldn't stand the heavy-duty selling on every darned screen.  Maybe some people can tune this stuff out, I couldn't.)",

I was switching from a Logitech Wave keyboard, and found that the slightly smaller keyboard and different layout gave me a little trouble at first, but I began to adjust fairly quickly.  The Logitech G-Hub software is ok: in my opinion not quite as good as the Razer Synapse software in ease of use and configurability, but good enough.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new GX keys do not allow the secondary characters on the keys (the symbols accessed by using Shift) to be illuminated.  So there I am, looking at brightly lit characters, and finding myself peering occasionally to be sure I'm hitting the right key for the shift character.  Maybe a perfect touch typist wouldn't care, but I need to occasionally look, especially when I'm typing the less frequent characters. (My understanding is that this is a limitation of most mechanical keys: only the upper part of the key can be properly lit, so the only solution is to have the two characters side by side at the top.)<br /><br />A minor flaw is the need to use two USB slots to plug in the keyboard, because one powers the pass-through USB slot. What? How is that useful?  I'd rather just use a separate USB cable or hub and have the option of using USB 3, multiple ports, etc. I think this is just dumb, although I know that many buyers want a pass-through no matter what.<br /><br />I ended up returning this one and switching to a Razer TKL with linear switches, which has even better responsiveness and feel, and is just a bit more convenient to position. And as I said above, I like the Synapse software better.",

(I had been using a Logitech Wave for years, and I'm still a bit surprised by how much better this keyboard is for me overall.)<br /><br />Downsides?  Firstly, these are the keys with the secondary characters not lit: if you want those lit, you have to spend about $30 more to get the PBT keycap upgrade package.  (Or you can buy another Razer TKL product, most likely without a wrist rest.)  Secondly, I don't like the light under the keys, I think that's quite unnecessary and distracting, actually making it harder to read those unlit characters.  Oh, and my pet peeve is the Delete key being the same size as the others: I happen to use it almost as often as I use backspace, and much prefer keyboards where that key is made larger.<br /><br />Finally, you want to hope you never need Razer customer service.  My experience with them has been pretty bad: they're really slow, they don't do what they say they'll do, and it can take several days and multiple attempts to do something that with Amazon takes about 5 minutes.

I find that I have much lower fatigue using a good mechanical keyboard, and like the overall consistent response I get from them. Also note that these are the newer keys in which the shift characters are on the top row as well, so that both characters on a key are lit.<br /><br />Setup was easy: I decided I didn't want to bother with a wireless connection and the need to remember to recharge regularly, so I left the cord plugged in and used it as a wired keyboard.

I think my Shure earbuds might be just a tad better in tone, but I'm not completely sure about that (yet).\"<br /><br />Same thing here. The major problem I have with this model is that I couldn't get the headset to sit comfortably on my head: the over-the-head support bands are not adjustable, the inner one slides easily to stop at the rigid outer band, which is one size only. So, with my head not being as big as their design model's, the whole thing wanted to slide down further than I wanted, so it felt like a heavy headset resting on my ears.  Ugh!<br /><br />So, although I really like everything else about this headset, I have to take points off, and can't recommend it for most buyers.

Literally anything & everything you can do on your computer can be streamed to this. This & a wireless keyboard and mouse and you can easily use your computer on a display across the house.<br /><br />Not without some minor drawbacks. Wifi can be a bit laggy when gaming or streaming video, so you're best off plugging it into your router.

After playing my game for 15 minutes I was wishing I hadn't downloaded it because now I'm stuck with it.  I can't give it away, and I can't trade it in or resell it.  Only option we have is to play, and make the best of it.  But I will be spending the $5.95 to return the two unopened games to Amazon.<br />We have played the two previous ds games and loved them both, the 2nd was better than the first one.  Because of our experience we were very excited to play the new 3ds release.<br />There have been many changes made, some good, but more bad. The graphics are a nice improvement, and being able to play with in-game friends is a welcome addition.  We think it's cute having Nibbles, the vivosaur follow you around.<br />We feel they have made what used to be a fun game very annoying, and more juvinile.  The instructions are a little vague at times.  The Bone Buggies, while nice, are harder to control.  I realize that further in the game there are upgrades that improve this, but it will take some practice, patience, and feelings of frustration at the time wasted trying to maneuver into the position you want to go.  We don't like how you only have one chance at digging up a fossil.  Meaning you can't save before you clean a fossil in case you want to retry again.  But it can be convenient because you don't have to keep going back to clean them when your pockets are full.  It's nice that the jewels you find are automatically sold too.<br />Also, we do not like that they took away the ability to see where you are on the main Park.  The bottom screen shows the map, but now there is no dot on the map making it easy to know where you are, and where you want to go.  I found that convenient, and used it all the time on the other games. It takes getting used to this change, and wish it was still available.<br />One last thing I want to point out is there is no way we think this game should be compared to Pokemon.  It is my opinion it's being compared as a selling tactic because of Pokemon's popularity.  The Pokemon games are a favorite with our friends and family.",

I didn't realize at the time that I could move it later, so turned it off.  When I restarted, I was sad to discover Katt was not there, but other character's were.  Maybe this could be used to get your favorite villagers without using the cards.<br /><br />It's my understanding that only the special character's, like Nook, Isabelle, etc., need the amiibo cards if you desire to decorate their homes.  I have purchased a lot of the amiibo cards, but have not felt the need to use one with the game yet.  I guess I just don't care enough to use the cards, maybe later.

                "text": "I read all of the reviews before I decided to get this game. I too, like Deepak Chopra and I was excited to find this game.<br />Some reviews said they got more and more frustrated with each level and found they had to make wild movements to get the game to work.<br />I didn't find that to be the issue for me at all. I have found this to be a very relaxing game and I feel calm and centered after playing it.<br />There is a playing mode and and reflection mode for meditation.<br />On the play mode each level is centered on the chakras starting at the root chakra and moving up. You have a planet that rotates and from the center comes a colored spore that gives birth to a tree or mushroom. Before you start the level you see your mandala begin to pulse in and out and set you breathing to this rhythm, this is also the same rhythm for the remote for the side to side motion to rotate the planet.<br />And each level progresses in this manner. The point is to cultivate relaxation, the more relaxed you are the easier it is to play the game. I have noticed that when I play other games I don't get so riled up and I can stay calm and relaxed which does make it easier to play and retry a level without frustration. Good tool for the rest of life as well.<br />Knowing this helps to keep the focus in the game. Once you have gone through the play levels on all the chakras the free style meditation is unlocked, otherwise if you choose the reflection side you have only the guided meditation that is unlocked. I have found these to be very helpful to start my practice again. I sit in a regular chair not on the floor. If I sit on the floor I use a pillow folder over to get the height and stability needed. I find it works just as well.<br />I am pleased with this game and I continue to use it since I am gaining great benefit from it in all areas of my life. To help me relax I have incorporated an adrenal support that aids in relaxation and have found this has helped immensely.",

He says he love this game so i wholeheartedly recommend it (Hell what does a 51 year old man know anything about video games these days?

It has a super long cord, in case that is something you like or need.<br /><br />4.  The mouse wheel is like a lego tire with a very grippy tread.<br /><br />5.  The mouse has a good shape and all the butons have good click action, the side buttons have forward and back motion and this is the  first time ive seen it before, a dpi sensitivity switch that cycles through several dpi settings.<br /><br />6.  You can't change the pulse rate of the lights or turn off the light (someone said in a review that you can turn it off by holding down the button, not sure if that is true, because it isn't working for me with this mouse).

I like it so much I gave it 5 stars anyways, no reason to rate it downward but its important to know if you want to cover more than one controller.<br /><br />2.  Easy installation - I had a painful burnt finger so I got my kid to put the cover on this controller and it was quick and simple.<br /><br />3.  My hands are weirdly moist now.  Maybe it's all the pandemic lockdown handwashing and then moisturizing but ten minutes of gaming and the controller feels as slippery as a pumpkin seed.  Its gross and I want it to stop.  This cover is keeping me from dropping it.<br /><br />4.  I like the cover, it adds a dollop of color to an otherwise dull white controller, like a sportscar with a bra (is that what those leathery front covers were called, bras?).<br /><br />5.  Inexpensive - I got it for free, to review, but I'm going to buy a second fo my other controller.",

The keys arent too sensitive which is a good thing since it makes it harder to fat finger them and do something wrong ingame<br /><br />2.  The keys have a reasonable amount of space between them which means I don't have to be really accurate when typing or doing stuff ingame.<br /><br />3.  The lighting under the keys and the colors of the keyboard in general make it really easy to see the keys as opposed to some LED lit keyboards i've had in the past where the lighting feels too dim or too difficult to see because of the reflected color of the LED lights.<br /><br />4.  But my personal favorite thing about this keyboard is that this is very compact,it has the number pad, the F1-F12 keys, but it is still compact enough that I can fit it really well on my desk along with my wrist pad and a large mousepad.  I've had trouble in the past (since I keep my mouse very close to my keyboard 90% of the time) with having the edge of the keyboard, which normally juts out at an odd angle, end up pressing against the mouse which forces me to click it again.  This was an ongoing problem with my last keyboard and it's really good that I don't have that happen now with how well this keyboard fits on my desk.<br /><br />Now for some negatives;<br /><br />Just one, I'm not a huge fan of yellow, I wish this came in a nicer color.",

I enjoy playing in the different countries.<br /><br />I am 60+, have difficulty progressing in Rayman 1, and am often frustrated.  Currently bogged down in the hedgehog race. I would recommend both games for seniors. They help maintain hand/eye coordination, sense of timing, and both make you burst out laughing-if you enjoy the slapstick silly stuff. I do. My wife doesn't. I think younger children will find Rayman 2, easier to play. I'm not a hunter, but there's something about shooting rabbits with plungers, that makes your troubles go away.

As a senior, I recognize the value of this game.  It forces you to use, increase and maintain hand/eye coordination, and timing.  The dancing games are especially helpful. Some of the other Rayman Rabbid minigames have increased my heartrate to 125.  That adds worthwhile aerobic exercise to the game's other pluses.  Too difficult for my four year old grandson. One negative.  My wife doesn't play this game, but she leaves the room whenever I play it.  The dancing game makes her dizzy (just being in the room when I play it bothers her).  If you have a problem where fast dancing/flashing lights/quick though pleasant music bothers you, do not buy this game. See my review of Rayman 2.",

I agree with the other 2 reviews posted to date. Just purchased it, have played for 2 hours, and will update this ASAP.  It's a fun game with very good graphics.  I have not read the directions yet, (like to jump in and play first), and found swinging confusing until I realized how it works.  You lift your club until the blue line on the power bar, equals the distance you need to drive. Totally different than Wii golf, and should not be confused with a real golf match game.  However, there is enough golf, and interesting scenery, to satisfy my desire for a second game. This game is a sleeper, and will get much more playing time than some other titles I have reviewed.<br /><br />While Miis are not used, the characters are a definite plus. They are lifelike humans, rather than cartoonish. When you have some winnings, you take your character to the clubhouse, and dress them as you like. The costumes range from conservative to highly suggestive.  I wasn't able to purchase the new clothing, but I was able to change my character into the different outfits.  Initially, you only have a choice of 2 characters. I am using Hanah, a cute and personable girl of about 20. She has a cute voice. Based on my initial 3 hole practice round (done 4 times until my first birdie), I expect to put quite a few hours on this game.<br /><br />This is my update.  I have now read the directions.  Marginal help.  Then I went through the tutorial again.  I was making a lot of mistakes.  You need to go through the tutorial a second time.  It means more after you have played. You can change the direction of your putts and drives, just like Wii golf.  The special shots are fun. I just finished 3 more hours of play.  The game is addictive, once you understand it. You have to like humor. I like Rayman Rabbits.  I think 8 years and up is an appropriate age level. Girls 8+ will especially like the different costumes and accessories available.  Boys will just like the game play. It's also great for adults.  I'm a retiree.  The key is to go through the tutorial several times. Once before you play. then at least once after you have played for 1-2 hours. I was initially frustrated before I went back to the tutorial.  I think this is a great game and will be playing it quite a bit.",

Tetherball and slot cars are probably the easiest game. Dodgeball is probably the most fun, but more difficult.  Wallball is a nice game, but like dodgeball, on the more difficult side (for a 4 year old). I would rate each minigame in the package, entertaining. I think it's a nice 4 star game.

I have HDTV, and the Nintendo component cables, but found the graphics more blurry (less in focus), than other games.  I suspect this is caused by the need to have a tremendous amount of detailed graphics, of many different colors, in a very compact area. I do have my Wii and TV set to the proper resolution.

The problem is after you play 3 games on the real board you have enough points to buy almost everything.  You get the unlockable characters right away instead of having to work for them.  I understand that they were trying to change the game so it wasn't the same as their other games but they took out the best parts of the Mario Party series.",

Lots of snow and static on screen that didnt show up in a screen mirror on your real screen.<br /><br />Was ignored and treated very poorly by oculus support. After almost a month of using I frantically boxed it up and sent it back to amazon.<br /><br />I think I might pick up another from best buy and see if it does the same thing or not. I tested 3 high end vr pcs with it btw. But either way. I feel let down by oculus support. And Amazon didnt offer replacement of item. They only offer return or dealing with oculus. So I realized I better return this thing asap!<br /><br />I wish they were being more honest about the issues as I would repurchase once issues are fixed.<br /><br />Biggest let down with this device is trying to play non vr games in a vr theater. It absolutely does not work! The oculus drivers upscale everything into 4k even if the monitor being displayed is only 1920x1080... this results in unbearable stutter in the majority of non vr games. And this is something that an oculus go can handle over wifi with open source software like alvr and moonlight for go so I am shocked to see they dropped the ball so badly by not having a 1080p theater gaming mode.... it's actually unforgivable and I think I would have returned this item due to that fact alone if I wasnt having the USB power and snow static issues....<br /><br />I think they rushed the software and the skimped on costs for a high quality cable...",

I waited to buy the Quest afterwards actually it was so bad. Until I heard about the Oculus Link technology and witnessed first hand ALVR running PC VR on a Quest.... Bought one, I love it, Best thing ever!!!!!  Adding hand tracking soon along with the Link make this a no brainer!  The Rift S is dead!  This becomes a Rift Q with a good USB 3.0 cable. or wireless with ALVR like I said. One pro tip I can give you all though. instead of connecting to your local wifi network. buy a good USB 3.0 wifi dongle. and then create a hotspot network in windows withit. Conect to your hotspot via the quest and make sure your PC is wired to your network instead of wireless. but that last part is not a big deal with this method actually. But doing this will remove any network latency or traffic from your wifi. Simply go into your hardware settings for your wifi card and manually set it to 40 mhz and to only use 802.11 a/n/c or any combo of those otherwise the hotspot will default to b/g mode which you don't want. If you do this you can play ALVR wireless PC VR no problem! It's literally amazing!!!!! don't listen to the other methods. do it this way.",

                "text": "I enjoy the occasional game and decided I wanted to get back into handheld gaming.  While cell phone games do have plenty of engaging time-killing games to offer, I was missing games with some depth and story; like Zelda!  So I decided to go back to my roots and get a Nintendo console (my roots are the old DMG-1).<br /><br />After a shockingly small amount of research, I went and impulse purchased the New 3DS XL.  If this is your first 3DS, be sure to pick up a charger as well, since, unlike just about any other device that NEEDS a charger, this system does not come with one!  Taking the device out of the box, the first thing you will notice is the pristine shiny surfaces that greet you!  The exterior is shiny, but don't expect it to stay pretty.  It will pick up finger prints if you just look at it.  Not only that, but I had scratches on it after a couple weeks of keeping it in my bag (in a pocket that was microfiber lined and all by itself).<br /><br />Next thing you will notice is the weight.  This device actually has some heft to it!  It is only 1 or 2 tenths of an ounce lighter than the original Nintendo!  I found that I did get a but of hand and wrist strain during the first could days of play.  Just something to keep in mind!<br /><br />Another thing you will notice is that the hinge is a bit flappy.  When you open the hinge, you will hear it snap into place in two positions (and by snap, it sounds and feels like you are doing something wrong).  This wouldn't be a problem since the second position is where you will want the screen opened to, but the screen moves within that position.  I play a lot from a reclined or laying position, so I do notice the top screen wobbling quite a bit.  I would estimate that the movement is about 5 degrees.  It is enough that, if I am playing while laying down, I often find myself awkwardly positing my index fingers so they wrap around to the front of the device to keep it from moving while I am playing.  I have seen video of New 3DS XLs that do not have this issue with the hinge, but most people seem to have it, and people who have contacted Nintendo say that Nintendo does not consider this to be a defect.<br /><br />Even with all of the negatives I have listed, there is still so much to love about this device.  The top screen is beautiful and sharp.  The Super Stable 3D does great (even when you play in the dark).  The console comes with a few interesting games, so even if you don't by games right away, there is definitely lots of interesting stuff to do on the device.  The e-shop is great and even has some great games that you can get for relatively cheap including some old NES and Gameboy games.  The controls are generally ergonomic, although I find that the D-pad can be a little uncomfortable if you are playing a game that uses that instead of letting you use the thumb pad.  Streetpass and spotpass add a whole other dimension of entertainment.  There are a lot of great games available for the system for almost any genre.  All the old Nintendo franchises have games for the 3DS that have a terrific balance between familiar characters and new spins on gameplay that develop the story.",

It is also varied enough that you can sit and play long stretches if you want without getting bored.  I find the game a little more challenging then I anticipated, but certainly something that can be mastered.",

                "text": "I bought a New 3DS XL a while back, but quickly learned that it was a little bulky for my liking and I was noticing that I was having a bit of fatigue in my hands and wrists.  I really wanted the smaller device, but I didn't want to sacrifice the benefits of the new 3ds (better 3d and the C-nub).  I was also excited about the interchangeable faceplates.<br /><br />When I bought this device, it was the only North American option for a non-XL, so while I wasn't really into Animal Crossing, I was very into the smaller device, and since the faceplates are interchangeable, it wasn't a big deal to me (though I do wish that this bundle included the plain white plates as well).<br /><br />I shopped around and found a great deal online where I got this bundle for under $180 on Jet, so this was really a no-brainer.<br /><br />I do find that I still get some hand strain, not because of weight, but because of the way I hold the console; my hands are just slightly too big for long use comfort (typically, I get strain after about 1.5 hours of use).<br /><br />The new 3D face tracking is a big step up from the original 3DS.  The C-stick is not used for happy home designer, but has been useful in the handful of games that have C-stick functionality.<br /><br />I like the layout of this console better.  The cartridge in front design seems more ergonomic than the last 3DS, which had it in back where your fingers naturally lie.<br /><br />Overall, I think the New 3DS is a wonderful, polished console.  It is the perfect size for travel.  The new features increase the options for game developers (ZL/ZR buttons, c-stick).  The new 3D face tracking makes using 3D more immersive and less of a practice of patience.  As for the Happy Home Designer, I don't really have any interest, but all of those components are interchangeable, and the game arrives as a code that can be given to someone who will actually use it (it is not locked to the device).<br /><br />I have no regrets with my purchase of this console.  If I had list any complaint is that the new 3DS consoles do not come with the power supply.",

Now that Animal Crossing is out, I am using the stick more; the issue was getting worse and more annoying.  It was to the point that I was playing with my pro controller connected to my lite.  I picked this up and it came quick (original arrival date was the 25th (ordered on the 20th), but it still arrived on the 22nd.  You should note that this kit doesn't include the tri-wing driver or philips that you need to do the replacement, just some extra screws (that you don't need unless you aren't careful and end up stripping the tri-wing screws).  The replacement took less than 20 minutes, following a youtube video of the left stick replacement (it looks like the right stick replacement is a bit harder and more involved - the video said that the right stick may be too much for most people on the switch lite).  Put everything back together and I am happy to report that this stick works perfectly.  The color is a good match for the original and feels like the sticks probably felt when they we’re new.<br /><br />Update 11/2021: My left stick finally started to die again, but instead of drift, it started to be unresponsive when pushing to the right. Couldn’t remember where I put the extra stick from the last swap so I bought a new one.",

This game is massive and I have been playing it on and off for nearly two years.<br /><br />To start with there are over eighty different fighters all of which are unique and express their own individual personalities. I can't even imagine how much work it must have been to accomplish this, I have the utmost respect for these developer. Since I got the game I have spent nearly the entire game mastering the character link, it would take a lot of gameplay to master all of them.<br /><br />There are two major complaints when it comes to this game: online mode, and balancing. First of all, yes... I agree that online mode lag can be excessive, but I don't find that it causes me to lose many matches. Balancing is kind of tricky... As it is quiet apparent that not every fighter is made equally, I feel like most of these accusations of overpowered or weak characters are over exagerated, as every fighter has their own strengths and weaknesses. for example, little mac is well known to be one of if not the worst characters, due to his trouble returning to the stage, but when on stage, a good little mac player can be hard to challenge.<br /><br />The point is I think this is an amazing game, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone of any skill level.",

She was calling her parents to tell them — emotionally and with her voice slurring from the few drinks she admitted to having imbibed to gain the courage to make the call — that she was gay and this was why she had moved to New York in the first place, to find a more accepting community. It was at that point, where I was listing to this message while also ducking behind cover to avoid the gunfire from looters, that The Division hooked me. I am a big fan of Destiny, a game The Division shares a lot with in terms of a persistent online world, but in that one moment The Division showed more story than Destiny's entire campaign, The Taken King expansion included. Up until this point it was kind of a nonchalant &#34;Yah, take back New York, whatever.&#34; Now, however, the game had weight. You aren't fighting against some vague alien presence that for one reason or another is mad at the human race but everyone is too busy to explain why they are too busy to explain it to you, you are fighting for these people whose lives were suddenly uprooted. That's what makes The Divsion great. Ohh and the matchmaking is much better too.",

Reminds me of the keyboards from the 1980's. This Rii keyboard is wired, but It needs to be to power up the LED background.

The graphics are really awesome and has an excellent gripping quest design. There is enormous amount of choices you can make – choice in dialogue options, how to build your character, how to approach missions, and much much more. And even when missions stop, Cyberpunk 2077 keeps things interesting by turning you into a Batman Arkham-esque investigator. The fun factor, replayability, and value for money is undeniable. This is definitley the best gaming gift for this season that will entertain everyone. Fast same-day shipping in my area. Game arrived in perfect condition. Although a bit expensive, it is well worth the price.",

Well worthy of the series!<br />I'm a huge fan of the Bond games, and we have all of the previous ones. We got this one as soon as it came out, and were definitely not disappointed!<br />The graphics are a huge step up from previous versions. In the first 'training' mission, you're driving a car through city streets. The lights reflect off of the curves of the car, you can see inside to all of his controls and movements, the dents show up realistically, the back up lights glow softly, and if you bash it a bit, the trunk comes loose. The city around you has cobblestone streets, water rippling, streetlights that come down when you hit them. The attention to detail is just amazing!<br />As you then move on through the various levels, you see this same level of detail everywhere. From the Austrian castle and other alpine scenes, to the city scenes, watery scenes and more, each really shines.<br />The plot is very engaging and typically Bond. But in an attempt to show that this isn't about violence - he's a SPY after all, not a Rambo - you get bonus points for being stealthy instead of blasting in with guns, and for stunning or capturing enemies instead of killing them.<br />In fact, just about every area can be 'accomplished' in many ways. Bluster your way into an objective by a full frontal assault ... or sneak in the side way for extra points. Since you're also rewarded for your time and health, often the sneaky, non-violent way is the best.<br />You've got a huge array of equipment, weapons, armor and vehicles, and all work just the way you'd expect them to. I found the default controller configuration REALLY annoying, but a quicks stop in the config area got it back to the way I'm used to playing.<br />Plus, there's multiplayer! Play with up to four people at once on REALLY great maps with quite a bit of customization options on each one. Grab some bots for practice, and play arena, team arena, king of the hill, capture the flag, or other game types.<br />Definitely worthy of the Bond series, and highly, highly recommended to any first person shooter fan!",

It’s a lot of fun to mess with people by blowing stuff up, sending gang members after them etc. My only complaint though is a big one. The online play frequently locks up and actually causes my Xbox One X to shut off! This happens about 20% of the time. I’ve reached out to Ubisoft, but they have no response other than reinstalling the game, which isn’t the problem. It ONLY locks up when playing online through their Ubisoft servers. Watch dogs 1 did not have this issue, and checking the forums, I am far from alone, yet Ubisoft refuses to release a bug patch.<br />Overall, it’s one of my favorite games, which is why I’m so frustrated when the game randomly locks up hard. I have also found that there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of people playing online. The group races, or showdown events are rarely useable because of the lack of participation from online play.

As for single player mode, I like the arcade racer genre very much, and the cop chases are more difficult. It has replay ability after the story is complete, but it’s really just to collect more cars. Personally I think the off-road events are the most fun, but they are also the least available compared to race and drift events. A definite improvement over the previous NFS games, but there is still a lot of room for playing improvement. One specific annoyance is the inability to change the controls. The horn is located as a push on the left stick which also has major functionality for steering, so frequently as I turn a corner, the horn goes off. SUPER ANNOYING, seemingly an easy fix by allowing custom button controls.",

I have experience repairing small electronics so it was easy enough. I think anyone that can take their time and follow directions would be able to accomplish the repair easily enough.<br /><br />The package contains 2, I only needed one, and it was a good thing. The first stick would not calibrate, seemed a bit off. There was no drift but it didn't center once I let go. The other was perfect. Send company an email and they replaced the whole package very quickly. Despite the issue I'd recommend this for the repair if you have to do it.<br /><br />Quality issues can happen. I'll always stand by a company or vendor that takes care of the customer when something happens.",

With the charging cord, I easily connected and downloaded the updates, as suggested. Then I put them on. I didn't find they comfortable at all. In fact, I don't like the fit at all. The fit is just all wrong around my ears. I do wear glasses, but that did not factor into the fit. It is the earphone itself. The cushioned ear pad does not fit closely enough to cancel outside noises and it is irritating feeling the gaps. Got to say a no go for these. Oh, by the way, if you want to hear through these on your pc, you have to get a special adapter. When I plugged them in to charge, it showed up in my devices but when I turned them on I couldn't hear anything out of them except air. I have other headphones for my pc and will use them for the pc.",

So, I bought the game from Microsoft for $19.99 and then when I was getting everything out of the box, I found that there was a game code inside. Now I have to wait for Microsoft to refund me before I can play the game. That can take 72 hours. But, I have been reading about this laser gun and people are stoked. The games do not get the same amount of praise, but, as new ones come out, I am sure they will get better. Especially if this gets really popular with gamers. If you go to mars.pdp.com, you will find all the games that can be used with the system. Most of the issues have been with the games, not the Lightcon or the IR station. Another issue that has been cited, is the placement of the IR station. Follow the directions to get it in the right position. A neat thing, is that this can be played on any type of tv or projector that you can use an Xbox on. The gun gives you better control in your shooting ability. It does use batteries in the gun and the IR station is attached to the Xbox. Personally, I go on cruises alot and I can't wait for my refund so I can install using the code that came with the game. I also purchased Qubit's Quest but I can't download that one until I get the first game refunded. You can have up to four players. Extra Lightcons can be purchased on Amazon.",

Did some research, turns out many others had the same problem, until they went to the EVGA site and upgraded the firmware for this model, Z15. The keyboard automatically goes into sleep mode and the lights all go out, depending on the number of minutes you set before it goes into 'sleep' mode. It's a clacky keyboard, not a silent one.

I've been an avid gamer since I was about 11 (til present-23), and when I saw this controller existed I flipped and just knew I had to have it. However, the times I almost bought it, it was at a ridiculous price of $160 or so. I waited it out in hopes of getting it for half that price if I was lucky. Finally about a month or so ago I got it from a great seller for about $60. I immediately bought it. I was really worried, as the seller was just launched, but after emailing them and getting polite and prompt responses about my inquiries, I took a chance. I'm glad I did because when I opened the box, a brand new boxed up pink 360 mint condition wireless controller was in it. I absolutely love it and can't believe how fast it came. I got an incredible deal and I'm so glad I waited to get it. This controller is sick and I also love how the Xbox home button on the controller glows white instead of green! Highly recommended!",

Just when you come across a level and think after finishing it, &#34;god, what kind of douchery was that...&#34; The very next level will be ten times harder (not all the time, but very often).<br /><br />This game will make you rage. I don't care if you're the most experienced gamer in the world- there's never gonna be any gamer that says they beat every level without dying at least once. I died maybe 40 times on one level alone.

I got this because of the review for this product I read that gave it 5 stars, but ended up returning it after trying it on in the parking lot. So here are some pros and cons if you are reading this and trying to make a decision.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Feels great in your hands<br />- Solid grip, not slippery<br />- All cutouts are almost completely accurate<br />- Has big controller-like bumps in the back for better grip<br />- Kickstand is still usable unlike with most cases<br />- Easily removable- hassle free<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Two buttons (right arrow and Y) rub slightly against case (makes it feel a little off)- other than that, all cutouts are flawless<br />- The front top and bottom pieces of the case are not anywhere near snug like the rest of the case, they are actually somewhat flappy and loose- nothing major, hence why only one star was deducted, but for $30, it really should be a little better<br /><br />I’d say this case is worth $10, maybe $15 if these problems were addressed. I would definitely buy again if they were. But those small things were enough to bother me (I’m a perfectionist with stuff though so I’m very articulate/picky). However, this would definitely be a 5-star product for the people who would shrug these issues off. Overall, I do recommend but I definitely wouldn’t buy again for $30.",

                "text": "My fiance and I just got a Switch and we wanted the screen protected, so we went with some “officially licensed” garbage from Best Buy for $8. As soon as I put it on, there were bubbles all over and two ridiculous smudges that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere (and I know I didn’t cause them). I immediately afterwards put an order in for this product. It only took two days because of Prime and arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />I put up pics of both the Best Buy one which brought only one protector, a wipe, a crappy cheap cloth, and a thing for bubbles (barely worked) and the Cellularize one which brought two protectors, two wipes, two nicer cloths, two things for bubbles (which I only had a couple very tiny ones so not a big deal), and two sticky sheets in case anything got stuck to the adhesive side of the protector.<br /><br />The quality between the two products is immediately noticable, especially when you feel the protectors. I feel like the Best Buy one was plastic. No joke it could bend like crazy. If you do that with tempered glass (what an actual screen protector SHOULD be) then it will shatter after force is applied. Anyways, this one feels SO nice and heavy duty. It was easy to apply and is VERY clear with perfect cutouts for the little areas that need them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone thinking about switching screen protectors or buying a new one. I mean $6 for two quality pieces. You just can’t beat this. My ONLY minor complaint is that they advertise it as “bubble-free” but that’s not accurate. However, if you know what you’re doing, it takes seconds to get rid of them. If you have trouble using the bubble-removing thing, just gently and slowly lift the corner nearest the bubble and reapply which will make it disappear.",

The graphics are great, the gameplay is fun and the sound is very good.<br /><br />When I got the game, I popped it in to the PS3 and after an update was at the main menu. I went through the options and stuff, and found out there could be two players. My daughter quickly grabbed a controller and decided to play as the &#34;spirit&#34;.<br /><br />I played as the main character, doing things like walking around and beating people up. She played as the ghost or &#34;spirit&#34; Aiden(?) and could move stuff and do other supernatural things. Basically you switch between the two characters to get things done, CIA spy stuff or teen &#34;Carrie&#34; stuff, or even saving homeless people stuff. She got really mad when I wouldn't do what she wanted me to do, but I told her I play like I want and she plays like she wants.<br /><br />As Aiden she can be mean and vengeful or helpful and peaceful. Once we finish the game we will have to switch parts, I want to try being a ghost and totally poltergeist that party of rowdy teens!<br /><br />If there was more gameplay and less interactive movie, I would have given 5 stars. It's major funage, and even better with a friend (or relative). It's mostly like Heavy Rain; press a direction or hit a button fast. Sometimes I didn't know which direction to press in a fight, it was confusing a little, but I couldn't &#34;die&#34; so it was all good (after some practice I got better, but the fight sequences could have been a little more clear).<br /><br />So if you are looking for a good story (told out of sequence, yeah for nonlinear) and like interactive movies, this is the game for you. And it's cheap.<br /><br />And buy &#34;Heavy Rain&#34; too! It's also wicked fun, more so with the PS3 Move.",

I had it on the 360 but it never got all the DLC or updates that the PC did, so when I saw it was coming out for the Xbone with all the maps included I had to get it. That was a mistake.<br /><br />There are some issues with the voice chat, but that can be worked around by being in an XBL party and chatting there. When you try and pick your heist online, in game it's called Crime.net, the game locks up for few moments every 10-15 seconds seconds, but that is more of an annoyance then anything. The real issue is trying to join games online: you can't. When you go to Crime.net and see a game that someone is in that you want to join, you select it then on the next screen you can join it. If you try and join, it locks up for a few seconds then boots you back to the main Crime.net screen with an error message stating you can't join the game.<br /><br />You can't play with people online.<br /><br />You can start a game and invite people, and be invited by others, but if you have no friends with the game or none are online when you are, you will not be able to play with others.<br /><br />There is a single player game of course, but you only get 2 AI players and they can do nothing except shoot and be shot. So good luck hauling bags of jewels to the escape van, it's all on you.<br /><br />If the game worked it would probably get 5 stars from me. The state it is in now, it gets 1.<br /><br />Oh, and as of this review it's been out in the US for about a week and there is still no patch. It was also released in the UK even earlier and there is still no patch. The previous console versions were never updated and never got the DLC that they promised players, which makes me wonder if they are going to do the same for current gen consoles now. Take the money and run? I hope not; my fingers are crossed that the game gets fixed.<br /><br />I will update my review if things change.<br /><br />*** UPDATE***<br /><br />The game was patched! Finally! Yes! It no longer freezes when you try and join games online. Well, it doesn't freeze every few seconds on the Crime.net screen anymore. It still freezes when you select a job and try to join a game, and it still won't let you join any games.<br /><br />I added a star for effort to my rating.",

I know it was a browser game at first, and has been released on numerous platforms, but I needed more games on my Switch and had been wanting to try this one out for a while.<br /><br />It's a 2d side scroller. You get health and weapon upgrades as you shoot your way around a few different parts of an underground world. There are multiple endings and after I won the game I actually went right into a second game to see a different ending.<br /><br />Included are some trial levels too, like use X gun and Y ability and get to the end of the stage. They unlock as you do things in game, I only unlocked one and I didn't enjoy it much.<br /><br />There are some downloads coming later this year I think, multiplayer or something, and more trials.<br /><br />If you like other versions of the game, or have never played before, this is the game to get.",

The graphics are nice for the arcade feel it’s going for, Every single character has a story line, Some you’ll know from the movie, Others you’ll meet for the very first time and fall under the funniest of stereotypes. But in all honesty this game does what it sets out to do well, Arcade boxing. It’ll hurt your fingers after a few fights from the button pressing and the frustration but it’s a fun fight. The sounds are funny to hear minus Rocky. When you pick Rocky in the story mode every single time his dialogue bubble pops on the screen he does a weird grunt in the most Stallone way possible it’s hilarious. All in all it does what it sets out to do, It’s not done incorrectly, It’s not budget made as most of us are used to. It’s a good quality, Arcade feel, Fantastical boxing game that gets a 4 out of 5 stars. Get it if you miss arcade boxing games, Get it at a lower price if you have no idea what arcade boxers even are 💥🌟",

Let’s start with part 1, It’s an arcade port. Think of it as an endless runner with being able to kill the enemies and platforming that gets gradually more difficult, It’s the weakest in the series but has held up pretty well! Part 2, An arcade port once again but the dynamics that are featured heavily in later monster world titles come from here, This game is the foundation of the game as we know it today so probably the most important one in the series, Be forewarned it is a quarter muncher as it is an arcade title but with an endless rewind feature and save states, You won’t have much trouble getting through it. There are some parts that I’m left wondering how you’re not supposed to spend $10 in quarters to beat it back in the day. As for 3 and 4 there’s a huge shift in quality and gameplay, These are not arcade titles but ports of the Sega console titles, They’ve honestly aged really well! After playing part 2 know what to expect from part 3, But part 4 is my personal favorite! It’s the metroidvania of the series very reminiscent of the Shantae series. This one is legit fun and I highly suggest that you check out the remake that came out not long ago if you like the original! (or you can just get the remake, which includes the original, Decisions decisions). The extras are honestly bare bones, You get an image gallery that looks like it was thrown together in 2 and a half minutes to make it look like the game has more content, Deff one of my least favorite parts of the compilation as it makes it look a little cheap. All in all it’s a nice compilation and worth the $29.99 and if you find it on sale even better! The classics are all here and you can change the aspect to full screen with crisp graphics or it’s original resolution or even throw in a CRT filter to make it look truly old school. It’s a 7/10 for me. I go by the .5 rating system by the way so it’s not a high 7, just an fyi! Try it out if you enjoy classic gaming! Hope this helps",

It had obscure ones, Newer ones, Japanese only ones. It was so great to have so I expected a similar collection here and boy, Was I utterly disappointed. This is the most bare bones, barely replayable and Uber expensive collection I’ve EVER COME ACROSS. I love collections of old arcade games Such as the Capcom arcade collection, Sega collection, Wonder boy collections and so forth, I’m a sucker for them actually, But THIS? This is what we get for $40? Do yourself a favor and get the ps2/GameCube era collection..Or play the roms because this is an insignificant rip off that’s worth $10. Seriously, over charging here would be $25. $40 for games that are nothing more than a mediocre collection of non memorable 80s games? HARD PASS. I love collections, I am the target fan base for these but this, This is not it. If inflation had an overcharged game in the 2020s, This right here is it. Stay far away. This gets a whole 0.5/10. The half a score is because it exists and the games aren’t terrible but EXTREMELY overpriced.",

Know what to expect, This is a game made by a handful of people, It’s not your typical AAA assasins creed live game service, It’s more in the vein of the gothic series, If you’re not familiar with that the most closely I can compare it to is Mid 2000s BioWare games: (Knights of the old republic, Jade empire, dragon age) You’re in this huge open world and travel around trying to get people on your side to help with the incoming invasion. The story is A LOT better than I expected it to be, The graphics are ok, I won’t give that one too much credit on the grand scale of things but for such a small team? It’s impressive. The gameplay is fantastic, The game doesn’t hold your hand as much it’s a lot about you discovering locations, looting, Finding secrets, Branches of conversation that dictate the destruction around you (Good and evil plots) But honestly if you miss playing games with big open worlds, Looters, You enjoy the fallout series and have time for a game that’s about 30 hours long then do yourself a favor and check this one out! Thank me later! But remember, Don’t expect AAA. Small team, small budget, BIG ideas. Hope this helps!",

Super Mario bros on NES was the first game I ever played in my life, I was 3 yrs old in 1988 and it came bundled with my Nintendo, I get EVERYTHING MARIO, I mention this so you don’t think I’m just hating on this just to hate, Quite the opposite, It hurts that I’m writing this review m, But if I can help someone save $60 I will, In this economy I know ID appreciate it.<br />I’m not going to go too much into detail here so let me simplify it, It’s a fun game, Really fun in fact..IF there was ANYTHING to do! No story mode for some illogical reason so we get cups, ok fine I was willing to live with that, The cups are ALL THE SAME EXACT THING. Since there’s BARELY any characters to play the game with, All characters you choose you’ll be going up against, I’ve played against the exact same team that I’ve chosen multiple times! This looks like it was made in a few months, Aside from an amazing looking opening introduction FMV, This game falls completely short and is an utter disappointment not only to sport fans but Mario fans.<br />Nintendo has had the trend recently with their sport games to release unfinished titles, Mario golf star rush didn’t have a lot to do but honestly I feel bad that I EVER COMPLAINED with that game. It had a story mode, it had competitions and a competent multiplayer. The multiplayer aspect of the game is an utter letdown, You believe well they didn’t concentrate on single player so Multiplayer must be making up for it somehow, Absolutely not. You would think if everyone had their own switch they can play each character on your team (There’s 4 of them) But no, You can’t. Up to 2 only. And get this, YOU CANT CONTROL THE GOALIE. Ever! One of the biggest points of strategy in sports games is controlling every aspect, And the goalkeeper has to be a dumbed down CPU controlled player. In all honesty I can keep going over how utterly bare bones and disappointing this game is, But..Don’t waste your hard earned money. Times are tough right now, And this game can care less. Shame on the industry for releasing this at $60, But I think we’re the biggest suckers here. 3.5/10. AVOID.",

On rails shooter (You can’t freely move for those that don’t understand the lingo) That you button mash and find weak points on the zombies, Fight a boss, Fight a super zombie, Fught a super boss. Wash, Rinse and repeat. Aside from the simplistic nature, It’s fun as all hell. I love playing through the campaign to get better scores and branch out to different paths. The remake graphics aren’t mindblowing in the least bit, But they are nice. I am hoping for the sequel they add a bit meatier content, I love that they were faithful to the original but these games don’t need a faithful recreation, But to have been inspired by it and expand on the basic lore from these stories into something a little bit more…2022 perhaps.<br />The music is your basic rock riffs, The sounds are nice and the features are actually pretty cool! Owning the physical edition is phenomenal, I love the Limidead cover art with the 3D card and the cardboard cutouts included inside, Great package, Wait for a sale if you’re unsure..it’s super short, About 45 minutes to be exact but it has a ton of replay value, So grab a friend or your partner and travel back to a simpler time. 7.5/10",

It this bad in a game in years, And this is the series X version we’re speaking of here. The graphics look like the characters were dipped in grease and have the most dead looking faces I’ve ever seen, Nothing in this world feel alive.<br />The gameplay is just as bad, Aside from there being ABSOLUTELY NO ACTION, 0%, None, Nada, Could’ve been forgiven if the game has a strong plot since you know…That’s what would have to hold it down as it has pretty much nothing else to rely on, It is excruciatingly boring. It’s hard to get through the story, Hard to care for the characters, And in a game that gives the illusion of dialogue choices, You pick the answer you like and you guessed it, You get it wrong. So you have to power up some of your abilities to be able to answer these questions, But the game mentions a brief introduction on how to do this in text on a menu and you never see it again. Right when you begin you can’t talk much, So why are the options even available? Is it for a second play through? This is the kind of confusing mess you’d be walking into. This game is worth at MAX $15-$20 price range. I support devs, I support indie games, I give things a chance, But save your hard earned money, And your time. It’s bad, Maybe if you catch it on a super sale and if you’re still interested with the knowledge of what I wrote above then hey, Power to you and I hope you enjoy it, But in all honesty…This is the worst next gen game I’ve played, And one of the worst full priced releases I’ve ever touched. Well its $10 less or $20 less depending o the generation you own. Glitchy, Buggy, greasy, Dead eyed graphics, HORRIBLE sound that’s uneven in my surround sound and on the stereo in my television, Terrible tutorials (Pretty much none after an initial text on screen) Terrible story, Cringe worthy voice acting and no gameplay minus “investigating” which means walk up to something..Press A or X depending on the console, and follow a trail, enter a room, press A again. This game is a full on stinker. 1.5/10",

This game is fantastic, So good in fact I had it on ps4 and when I upgraded to the series X I got it again for the extra characters and the HUGE reduction in load times. The graphics take a bit to get used to, It’s a modern rendition on cel-shaded graphics from the ps2 era. The moves are fantastic in this game, However they did simplify the control scheme for players who are new to the series, I’m not one to complain as the more players there are the more chance there is for the series to keep moving along. Great sounds from the game, Incredible move set, Nice character selection, Detailed levels, Although in this day and age I do expect a deeper story mode and that’s where my negatives come in, With as much more and as much experience as this title has under its belt it’s about time they give it the Story mode treatment that’s not just a beginning text, A middle standard cutscene that’s the same for everyone, And an ending unique to each character which is blink and you’ll miss it. I do love the series, And I hope this is the reset button to make a fresh new start to make it much bigger and better on the next one, If you’re new to the series start here! And if you’re not and you’ve been waiting for a price reduction, Now is the time! All in all a strong 8.8/10. Based on price at the current time, Graphics and sound. Story is lacking and therefore it recieved a reduction in score as well as a few ticks off for other bugs encountered during gameplay.",

The graphics are nice, But that isn’t the main draw of the title, We all know the switch is dated hardware, But the gameplay is PHENOMENAL.<br />The story, To the point where I am at least has been absolutely engaging. It knows how to hook you in and develop in a way that you want to know what’s next. So many different areas to explore and secrets to uncover, Crafting, Cooking, Class switching, Gem creating, Character Merging, Honestly I can go on and on, I’ve never on Amazon left a perfect review for a game, But in all honesty I don’t have to play it all the way through to know that there’s no way this game will go downhill the further along you get, It starts in the midst of action. You don’t need to play previous Xenoblade titles as it’s its own beast. If you have played the previous titles it does have certain nods to it and story elements that tie it in, But think of it as final fantasy, It’s just a numbered entry in the universe of Xeno but it’s not a sequel. If you’re on the fence on getting it, I was as well…I understand all too well how you feel but do yourself a favor and pick this one up, It’s a strong contender for the best switch game I’ve played which was previously held by Breath of the wild…This game is a 10/10.

The presentation is crystal clear and you can literally customize it to your complete liking! Then why not a perfect 5 stars? Well….<br />There’s no new ground here. Aside from the unreleased darkstalkers title, Most have played these games in various other collections, But what baffles me the most is that this came out 2 weeks apart from capcom Arcade collection 2, Which included most of the games listed on here already! I feel like it was a bit of a cash grab to do that to the fans. I love old school capcom (You can only like current time capcom if you enjoy resident evil or Monster hunter since that’s all they seem to put their efforts on to these days)<br />It’s an amazing little collection, Is it worth $40? A little hard to say. If you don’t love retro gaming or are new to the genre in general this would exactly be the best place to start. The games are unforgiving in difficulty, Although you can change the settings technically but my kids tried at the lowest difficulty and failed. I can rock it with the difficulty almost all the way up so it’s honestly just a matter of patience and learning curves, Which you will get! But if you want a quick fix, Try Capcom arcade 2 on the digital storefronts. If you want some Hadoukens, Yoga fires, Vampiric and (oddly enough) Cyber mecha fighting, Then look no further! Beautiful graphics that can be smoother out in options or even made to look like the days of the arcade!<br />Great selection of games (Although a bit lacking on it being different properties rather than SF, Darkstalkers, etc)<br />The sound is top notch and everutging can be customized to your liking!

If you ask for an invitation to buy a ps5 from amazon and get an invitation in your email , you for sure 100% can order one . It’s not a free for all like the other method for buying it from the manufacturer for retail . I love that Amazon made the process easy and straightforward. It’s a great system , our ps4 couldn’t handle some games and would sound like it was getting ready to take off flying . The ps5 is so smooth and quiet . Doesn’t overheat . It’s been fun for sure . Worth the wait . Paying Retail is awesome. I like buying directly from amazon as the seller. It did get dropped off with my bottled water boxes and just left . If you order one be aware it will just be left on your doorstep like it’s a $12 case of water . Not signing for it surprised me a lot .",

Rosewill used to be a bit bargain basement, but they've really stepped it up recently, and this is a great, low-cost option to get some real Cherry MX switches under your fingertips for cheap.<br /><br />I was originally looking at [[ASIN:B00S5E4KH2 Rosewill Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Cherry MX Blue Switches (RK-9000V2)]], which I am sure is a great keyboard, but I did notice that the reviews stated that the cord left something to be desired. I purchased this for typing in an office with a sit/stand desk, so a weak USB would not do. I didn't want to pay too much through, so I waited it out with my membrane keyboard.<br /><br />When this dropped to $79.99 (blue backlight only), I jumped on it. The Cherry MX Blue switches are clean, precise, and sound great. I need a wrist rest when I work because I stand, and find the one that comes with this to be sufficient (it's hard, but I like it that way).To top it off, the cord is a gorgeous, heavy-duty braided nylon. It's not detachable from the keyboard, but I didn't want that anyway. The extras were nice... I don't need gaming keys, but I appreciate the cleaning brush and the keypuller (in case these wear over time).<br /><br />Overall, this keyboard is easily worth much more than the $79.99 I spent. There are better choices for gaming, but I doubt you could do better if your main goal is simple, quick, precise typing. I highly recommend this.",

Reading reviews here on Amazon, searching for case buying guides on Google and even reading a few long and opinionated threads on reddit. I then decided on the Butterfox case. Before I tell you my opinion, here's what was my requirements.<br /><br />- sturdy, solid case, able to protect from bumps<br />- handle, so it was easy to carry<br />- storage for cables, joy-con straps (not the joy con grip, just the straps)<br />- storage for games<br />- no pesky elastic straps that might rub against the console<br /><br />Happy to say the case delivers on all accounts. Starting with storage, it has enough room for a USB-C cable (6ft Anker cable) and the joy con straps. It's probably too tight for a charging plug as well, but I carry an Anker 5 port charger separately anyway.The cables all sit in a zip pouch.<br /><br />There's a center flip part that can hold your switch games. It holds a lot. I haven't counted how many, but more than enough.<br /><br />The switch sits snugly in the case. Not too tight but tight enough to hold it snug. So it's easy to get in and out. Butterfox were smart and there's a handy piece of material to make it easy to lift your switch out. The game card flap then velcro's down to provide extra protection of the screen and hold the switch in place.<br /><br />All of the zippers are smooth. There's no weird plastic smell. Overall, very impressed.<br /><br />Negatives<br />None. Wish I had purchased one with color zips. I purchase the entire black one. Which is great, but I wish I had some color to make it stand out in the bottom of my bag.",

Approaching photo-realistic. The scenery in O:SW is PHENOMENAL, great late-afternoon sunset lighting with beautiful little touches like bits of fluff from weeds providing counterpoint to the action and firepower. The graphics really pop.<br /><br />The \"live ammunition\" takes some getting used to in much the same way that it took me a while to figure out how to play the PC version of Lemmings oh-so-many-years-ago. It's GREAT fun, very imaginative, and the mazes are terrific so far. The villians are as rotten as they ought to be and the Stranger is a brilliant idea. I'm really looking forward to getting through my day and firing up the Xbox to play some more, and I just don't play that many games (I'm an OLD fart).

The trees are too small compared to the humanoid figure in A New Leaf, too. Look at a Gamecube version capture and a New Leaf capture. Why are the trees so small? Weird.<br /><br />In my old Gamecube save, after 12 years, I have *LOTS* of flowers. And they look great. And I don't need to water them constantly. This is kind of a big deal with me. I really like planting flowers in the Gamecube version. I'm not so sure I want to commit to watering so many flowers in New Leaf.<br /><br />I'm not wild about being the mayor of the town and having to organize things. I just want to play the game. I don't particularly want to be responsible for the whole town.<br /><br />The area at the back of the shopping district / high street is disturbing -- some kind of showcase for home designs? Why is it so big? It's not a pleasant area. I wish it had been devoted to big garden plots to grow vegetables on, something like that. I don't like the Happy Room Academy in the first place. That big wasted space on the map is creepy, makes me think of nightmares where stuff doesn't make sense. Why is it on the map?<br /><br />I still prefer the point of view in the original game, the way the camera moves as you run along.<br /><br />The flowers are too detailed in A New Leaf. They just are.<br /><br />The Island is fun to visit, but I miss Kapp'n rowing his boat, and his songs in the Gamecube version were a lot more fun. He seems to have gotten married and settled down and become... boring. He traded his rowboat for a motorboat? Why was that considered to be an improvement?<br /><br />The mini-games on the Island are amusing but something I'd think of more in a Monkey Ball game. You collect medals, which you use to buy items on the Island.<br /><br />The wet suit and goggles are great, but you can't see anything under water, which is something of a disappointment.<br /><br />Interaction with Tom Nook is minimal, his nephews run the store on alternate days from one another.<br /><br />You know, all the pieces are there, but it's not as much fun as the Gamecube version. I never played Wild World and I was seriously unimpressed with City Folk. I was hoping this would be another great version, to the point where I spent $275 or whatever it was buying a 3DS XL. And I haven't been playing the game constantly, or even often, really. Meanwhile, I *STILL* play the Gamecube version nearly every day.<br /><br />I wish they'd expanded the Gamecube version, not reinvented it. Maybe over time I'll grow to enjoy New Leaf more. Right now it feels like work to play it. Kind of like a cartoony Sim City.<br /><br />I still love the Gamecube version. I'd like to think that I'll grow to love New Leaf. I remember feeling excited and happy first playing the Gamecube version and I wonder why I don't feel that way about New Leaf.",

Im not a GTA fan so id have preferred Far Cry but for 414 still was a great deal. Also as i was digging through the box they also gave me a 10 dollar ps store voucher which was pretty cool considering all the free stuff already. One HUGE complaint is the earphones. Ridiculous earbud...one mind you. Ill give Xbox credit for actually giving us a real headset with the One. It was also a 100 dollars more so that could be why. Graphics are very nice and no more diesel truck noises when the fan comes on like our ps3 does...sooo loud! Wish it wouldve came with a bigger hard drive too. Download some games and check your system memory...blow your mind. I bought 7 games for it and i dont think they will all fit...not sure what to do on that one. LOU is almost 50GB...huge game!",

                "text": "I'm a software dev and gamer and have been using mechanical keyboards exclusively for around 15 years so I own and have used quite a few of them.  This keyboard features the Razer 'Orange' switches, which have a pretty similar feel and sound to Cherry MX Brown, I'd say these feel slightly 'spongier' than the Brown keys, but not bad.  They are definitely not silent, but are not obnoxiously loud like Cherry MX Blue switches, and with the included rubber dampers they are pretty quiet to the point where I doubt they would bother anyone except the most picky of office-mates.<br /><br />Build quality is good, as you would expect from Razer, and the backlighting works well and looks slick.  That said, I'm not a huge fan of the low-profile keys which facilitate the backlighting.. they look odd if the backlighting is not on and I don't like the way it feels if I rest my finger below the spacebar.  That said, at least the low-profile keycaps do prevent things from getting lodged between the keys and make it easier to clean.<br /><br />The other thing about this keyboard that I really do not like is the lowercase font used on many of the keys (ie enter, ctrl, alt, shift are all printed in all lowercase).  I've never had another keyboard that used lowercase characters on those keys and I don't know why but something about it really bothers me.  Also, on the number keys the position of the symbol and number are reversed compared to every other keyboard I've ever had.  On most keyboards you have the @ symbol at the top of the key, and the 2 underneath it.. but this keyboard has the symbols below and the numbers on top.  Again, this seems like a minor issue and probably wouldn't bother most people, but it really triggers me..<br /><br />All in all, this is a well made keyboard with great key feel and relatively quiet switches, I would recommend it to most people but if you are a graphic design purist who gets frustrated by poor font choices and misaligned characters then you may want to look elsewhere.",

I was pretty salty about this and probably would have never bought another Mad Catz product but when I got the opportunity to try out the new RAT8+ via the Amazon Vine program I knew I had to give them another shot.. and I'm glad I did because wow I forgot how much I love the RAT series shape and ergonomics.<br /><br />I have been using the Logitech G502 which is an amazing mouse with a great feel out of the box but the customizability of the RAT8+ is just on another level, and once I get it tweaked to fit my hand just right I do prefer the RAT8 over the G502.  One thing to note though is that the RAT series is pretty wide compared to many other mice and some people with small hands may not like it.<br /><br />The 16000 dpi sensor is probably overkill for most uses (I play FPS games alot and run low sensitivity, typically 800dpi) but the sensor works well and I don't have anything negative to say about it.  I don't use the RGB feature personally but its nice to have for those who like that kind of thing.<br /><br />Overall, great mouse and highly recommended for those who are fans of the RAT series or anyone with medium/larger hands looking for a highly customizable mouse..  I'm hoping that after all the turmoil Mad Catz went through with the RAT5/7 series that they got their act together and made a reliable mouse that will last because I do love the RAT series!",

The RGB lighting looks nice and works as expected, I didn't experience any issues with the v3 software that some other users mentioned so maybe they've finally fixed them.<br /><br />There are a few minor issues that lead me to take off one star: First is the short cable.  The cable for the USB hub is only 3 feet long.  Unless you want to have your headset stand sitting on top or directly adjacent to your CPU tower then you are going to need a USB extender cable.  I feel it should be minimum 6 feet in length..<br /><br />The second issue is the fact that all 3 USB ports are on front.  While this may be ideal if you are plugging in flash drives or some other temporary accessory, it looks sloppy if using it with things that have a cable and stay plugged in all the time,  It would be imuch better if they had one port on front and 2 on the back or something.<br /><br />Other than those two issues this is a great stand and sure to attract attention to your desk with the customizable RGB lighting.",

                "text": "I'm a musician and audio geek, have been collecting high end headphones, amps, etc for 20+ years and have been playing PC games even longer than that.  For the past few years I have been using the Sennheiser Game One headset with the GSX 1200 Pro amplifier as my gaming setup.  While the Game One doesn't sound quite as good as some of my other high end headphones, it sounds amazing considering the price and is super comfortable with an excellent mic for voice chat.  I have used a number of other wireless headsets and never been that impressed with any of them but I was excited to see what Sennheiser came up with.  A good friend of mine has the Bowers & Wilkins PX gaming headset which is probably the closest competitor to the GSP670 in terms of sound quality for a wireless headset (and also in a similar price range), so I will include some comparisons to that headset also.<br /><br />First off, I think it is worth pointing out that all wireless headsets make some concessions compared to wired ones, so you may want to keep that in mind when considering whether a wireless headset is appropriate for you.  All wireless headsets have a degree of latency, this GSP 670 seeks to reduce the latency using the 2.4GHz dongle connection instead of bluetooth and it is notably better than others but there is still some latency.  It seems that the headsets prioritize incoming data over outbound data, so the latency is much more noticable when using voice chat but I also notice it while playing FPS games (for instance when playing McCree in overwatch or using the Deagle in CSGO, both have a very sharp sound that makes the latency more apparent).  For this reason I would not recommend any wireless headset if you intend to use it as your main headset for competitive FPS gaming.  If you aren't super competitive though and you are the type of player who doesn't spend time worrying about your refresh rate and  other peripherals input latency then it probably won't bother you.<br /><br />Aside from the latency issue, all wireless headsets are heavier and less comfortable than wired ones due to the included batteries.  While this usually isn't an issue for shorter gaming sessions, it can cause fatigue and discomfort if using the headphones for an extended period.  Lastly, all wireless headsets tend to have a compressed sound due to the wireless transmission protocol which is most notable in the low frequencies.  The best wireless headsets (such as this one from Sennheiser and the aforementioned B&W PX) do a lot to mitigate these issues but they still can't match a good wired headset.  For that reason, I feel that wireless gaming headsets are generally best suited for situations where you are going to be sitting a good distance from the screen, ie gaming from the couch or something.  If you are just sitting at your desk in closed proximity to the PC then it doesn't really make sense to use a wireless headset in my opinion.<br /><br />If you've considered the drawbacks and still think a wireless headset is the way to go, then I would definitely consider the GSP 670 as it has arguably the best sound quality of any wireless gaming headset I have tried (after firmware update and some EQ tweaking).  It has better bass response and to my ears a more balanced soundstage than the B&W px.  While the GSP 670 wins in terms of sound quality and battery life, the PX is in my opinion much better looking and more comfortable than the GSP670.<br /><br />I normally wouldn't comment on the aesthetics of headphones since I'm usually not planning to wear my expensive headphones outside the house.. but for a gaming headset it is perhaps noteworthy since some people wear them when streaming.  The GSP series are without a doubt some of the ugliest headphones I've ever seen, and the 670 are even uglier than the others in GSP series since they are slightly wider due to the internal electronics for wireless.  Unless you have a ridiculously wide head these are going to look really silly on you.  Its very confusing considering that almost all of sennheisers other products have a very sleek and refined appearance, including the older Game One/Game Zero series.  While I do prefer the sound of the GSP 670, I would feel like a fool wearing them on an airplane despite their good noise isolation, whereas the B&W px are much more travel friendly (and have better active noise cancellation).<br /><br />So if I were in the market for a wireless gaming headset it would be a tough call.. the GSP 670 is slightly ahead in terms of sound quality, battery life, latency and mic quality but the B&W PX has better active noise cancellation, more portable, lighter and more comfortable and has a much more stylish and refined look. Personally I would probably go with the 670 since sound quality is most important to me but again it would be a tough call and I don't think you can really go wrong with either of them.. both are much better than the average wireless headsets on the market.",

This controller is heavy, heavier than most wireless controllers yet it is perfectly balanced because the weight comes from the dual rumble motors instead of a single battery.  The non-slip coating on the back has a great feel and is useful to prevent the controller slipping during intense gaming sessions.<br /><br />The mappable pro-pack that slots into the back has 4 programmable triggers and can be  super useful in certain games that require button combinations which are uncomfortable or non-intuitive.. simply remap the triggers to create an alternate way of performing the combo.<br /><br />The included carrying case is very high quality and should offer great protection when travelling with the controller.

The mic is still pretty good though and I do like how its fully retractable so it doesn't get in the way if you use an external mic.  The other downside is that these have a USB connection only (due to the chroma lighting effects) so that limits their use to devices that have a USB port, it would have been nice if they included an adapter to standard 3.5mm audio jack",

One problem that almost all of them have is fading of the letters on the key caps, which can happen rather quickly on the most frequently used keys.  And in my case, I also play the guitar and have calluses on my left hand that wear the keys on that side down extremely quickly.. within a month or two on some keyboards.<br /><br />Having worn down keys doesn't bother me *that* much really but it would be nice to have a set that doesn't wear down for once.. so I hope these PBT keycaps are as durable as they claim to be.  I've only had them on for a week now so can't really speak to long term durability but they do seem well made.<br /><br />I like the font and layout used on them much better than the default keys that came with my Razer blackwidow lite keyboard.

It uses the KRGD blue switches which are clicky similar to Cherry MX blue but these do have a bit different feel as they have a slightly longer overall travel and higher activation force than Cherry blue. (KRGD blue has 2.4mm travel and 60cN activation force compared to 2.0mm and 50cN for Cherry Blue switches).  That won't make a noticable difference for most users.. but if you have been used to typing on a Cherry MX blue keyboard for a long time this one may feel slightly awkward to you at first.  I installed spacers on mine to reduce the key travel a bit to make it more similar to Cherry switches that I'm used to.  Overall the switches feel similar to Cherry in quality except for a slight bit of key wobble on the space and shift keys.<br /><br />Note that this isn't an RGB keyboard, the switches have predefined colors and cannot change colors but you can change the pattern of lighting effects using predefined key combinations.  I wish it were possible to change the colors but at this price point that is probably not feasible.  One other minor qualm I have is that there are no markings on the keycaps to indicate the media key functions on the F-keys.  Overall though this is a nice mechanical keyboard for the price and feels similar to pricier boards with Cherry switches.",

I got this for just a little more and it has an adapter built in with a mixer which is awesome. I'm loving the design and color I just don’t like how if you put the volume all the way up it mutes your teammates but I guess that could be a pro for a lot of people & also the AUX port is placed closer to you and your body I wish it was placed elsewhere but besides those little cons it's an absolute dream. I've only had it for a day but WOW. If anything comes up ill make sure to update my review<br /><br />Update: I’ve had it for over 2 weeks now I believe and I fell in love with it had to come back and give it 5 stars! It’s just so super comfy you almost forget you’re wearing it it’s breathable no sweaty ears and once again the audio sounds super crisp. A must buy for Xbox gamers",

When I take them off, I have to lay them down in a very specific  way to keep the cord from tangling. Something about the material feels like it wouldn’t be good if it linked. Also the headphone line does not disconnect from the headset, so if the audio line breaks, you’re SOL and would have to buy a whole new headset.<br /><br />Mic seems to be good, way better than my previous headset. I like that it can be detached. The mic attachment bends / adjusts really well, much better than the headsets with the fixed straight mic",

                "text": "When Sony first announced the Move controller, I'm sure everyone was scratching their head with questions like: Why bother, Nintendo already has this covered? What's with the glowing ball? Why the camera?<br /><br />Forgot all you've learned with the Nintendo Wii. I have the utmost respect for Nintendo for getting the motion control ball rolling, and I enjoy the Wii system for what it is, however, the motion control on the Wii is not all it's cut out to be. I'm sure like many of you, when you first got the Wii at launch, thought the motion sensor would track your every move. You couldn't wait to bowl, box, or swing a sword,  just like you would do in a real environment. The sad truth is, all of the wiimote's movement which \"talk\" to these games could easily be accomplished on your couch - even laying down. A simple flick of the wrist would translate to an on screen action. No need to stand up and bowl, why bother doing a full arm swing of your sword when it can be done without much effort on your part. In 2009, Nintendo released the Motion Plus add on for the Wii mote which certainly make it a lot more accurate, but not enough games support it just yet, and it still doesn't come close to what Sony has done.<br /><br />So what makes Sony's PS3 Move such a big deal? Well, for one thing, we're dealing with true 1:1 motion control. That funky glowing ball that was the brunt of many jokes happens to be the key to tracking your every moment; this, in combination with the PlayStation Eye. Once you begin to play any of the Move's games, you immediately sense you are not dealing with anything like the Wii. Not only does it sense anywhere in view your hand is, but it also detects how close or far you are to the TV.<br /><br />Sports Champions is amazing. The Table Tennis is so realistic, it's almost eerie. All the sports included are a blast to play (well, except for the Frisbee thing which I don't find interesting even in real life). Unlike WiiSports or Resort - you WILL work up a sweat because you will not get anywhere trying to sit in a reclining chair while the PS3 reminds you that your not in range. ;-)<br /><br />The other two games I've checked out were the EyePet and Start the Party. Both games use live camera feed, so now the player is inside the game! Yes, true augmented reality here folks. Your pretty illuminated  PlayStation Move Controller, suddenly becomes another object. Just look at the screen, you're now holding a Paint Brush, a tennis racket, or Ray gun! Folks, you have to see this to believe this. Yes, combining the player with the game's objects and its surroundings is another thing the Wii can't acheive.<br /><br />Overall, I'm so blown away by the Move's accuracy, The starting line up of games isn't much yet, but there's something for everyone and any choice will put a smile on your face. Plus, Sony and other manufacturers are already releasing patches to incorporate Move control into existing games like Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition, Tiger Woods 11 and much more. Oh, and loving the demo of \"The Shoot\" - can't wait for October. The system is very easy to set up -- and calibration is easy and super fast.",

Apparently, Start the Party was not much of a game for them, It's as if they reviewed this with 16 year old Call of Duty fans in mind. Come on folks, lighten up and have some fun.<br /><br /> While Sports Champions is without a doubt the strongest launch title for the PS3 Move, there's no denying that Start the Party has plenty of charm and some kick-ass augmented reality effects. Matter of fact, it's the best \"show off\" game of the bunch. Yes, there are only so many mini games you will take part of before they get repeated, but there are difficulty settings and various modes to break things up. This is not the kind of game you lock yourself in a room with and play through out the night. You invite some friends/family in front of the large screen TV and laugh your butt off! I'm sorry, but watching yourself on live feed holding various in-game items is absolutely eye popping hilarious. The mini games are actually quite fun, and technically make any WarioWare micro game look fossilized. Both young and old will have a blast; the very young will be hypnotized by the visuals,  and teens will probably have fun but won't dare admit it (the sorry state of adolescent males).",

Amazon came through - and the Kinect came through even further. People people people, trust me and anyone else who owns it. Nothing, I mean nothing compares. Every once in a while the debut of new technology comes out which gives you that rush of excitement that you want so much to share it with the world.  Every Kinect owner in forums, on Twitter, blogs, etc.. is flipping out over it; I know exactly what their feeling.  I have a PS Move and a Wii. I thank Nintendo for starting the motion craze, I thank Sony for improving Wii's technology 10-fold with accuracy (I love PS Move) and I thank Microsoft for totally bringing gaming to a level like no other. Oh and some quick points:<br /><br />- Lag - hardly noticeable a total non issue.<br />- Set up - easier then Wii if you can believe that.<br />- Space - we had 2 players at 6.5 feet and one at 5.5 feet all night. No prob!<br />- No detection problems, no voice command problems.<br />- Dance Central, Kinect Adventures, Kinect Sports & Kinectimals - a must!<br />- Sonic needs practice. Once you 'get it' it ROCKS - more complex then others. Some editors and reviewers should be kicked repeatedly for not giving it a chance. Must be a Sega vendetta for all the previous Sonics.<br />- The future:  It's only going to get better in the hands of creative developers.  I can only imagine what will come out of it.

The first day of playing, my body was all over the place, trying to lean left & right way too hard and by habit, turning my body forward instead off to the side (like a skateboarder). The character was drifting way off course and I was just getting angrier\". Well,  After a about the 3rd track in, the frustration began to dissipate, as I was able to nail a good deal of the controls,  which felt rewarding. Sonic feels more like a non-Kinect launch title - as it has more depth then the other titles. Yes, it's definitely true that sometimes, the game can be super finicky with your movement, but not enough to ruin the game like I originally thought.  Sega crammed a lot of moves in this game, so it's going to take practice, as this has a bit of a learning curve. I also like that it's the only debut game (I think) that has menu driven voice commands. Overall, thumbs up - but I would not recommended Sonic Free Riders to the casual gamer (lol - the irony).",

Of all my years of electronic playing, only two games kept my attention for years (no not days, months..years!): The RollerCoaster Tycoon series on the PC and Little Big Planet on PS3. Perhaps because I love anything which lets you use your creative skills and doesn't end via three day completion or quarter of the way boredom.<br /><br />Little Big Planet 2 goes so way beyond the original to the point that, I don't think I ever want to play anything else - ever (well at least until part 3 is released lol). There is so much to do that you get your money's worth in a way that no other game can provide. It's a bit overwhelming at first: Do I play the brilliant Tutorials and collect all the goods? Should I explore the millions of Community Levels, or do I begin playing the epic story devised by Media Molecule. Perhaps I should design my moon, or earth, or just queue up a bunch of recommended levels for later play. And after all is said and done, there's still the core part of the game: Create Mode!<br /><br />There's no end to the types of games you can build with this insanely epic sequel. The original Little Big Planet, paved the way with games which later went beyond the general theme. The original tool set was obviously designed with side scrolling platforming in mind, but creative individuals thought out of the box, and created games that you'd never thought could be accomplished. It was quite obvious creators had to go way beyond the limits of the tool set to come with something, other than what the game was intended for. I'm sure every creator hit a wall at some point and thought.... \"If only Media Molecule would have included...\"<br /><br />Well folks, they DID! Little Big Planet 2 has more tools than your hardware store. Plus tons of new objects, materials, stickers, special effects, and more. With the crazy new power ups, you conjure up unbelievable ideas. One major break through is definitely the \"Controllernator\" which actually lets you map commands to the entire PS3 control pad.  This revelation lets you create games in just about ever genre. The rage has just begun, and already we're seeing sports games, RPGS, puzzle action, adventure, retro games, casual, casino, 3D shooters, even cinematic movies! Not to mention, games specifically designed for versus multi-player which are identified by a special icon. Let's put it this way - many of the new creations will have you thinking you're playing a completely different game.  With over 3 million levels, there is no end to this spectacle. Every day you venture into Little Big Planet 2 is a new experience.  So, go ahead, jump in and choose anything your heart desires, or build your own epic arcade adventure. Rest assured, you will not be leaving this planet any time soon.",

                "text": "One Step Forward..<br /><br />I have to agree with the higher critic scores on this one. Let me start by saying, this is a Kinect game like no other. The story is cliche, with over the top acting, but that never stopped the Resident Evil series from being loved to death. Besides, what's a campy horror flick without bad acting? Maybe we should inform some \"professional reviewers\" that this isn't Hamlet: The game.<br /><br />Gross Fest Dead Ahead<br /><br />The graphics are dark and foreboding, like they should be --- with shades of browns, rusts, gold and a ton of blood red; actually, make that a more than a ton. Rise of Nightmares seems like part Saw, part House on Haunted Hill(the awful remake) and a \"rail-less\" House of the Dead.  There's even a creepy sprinkling of Silent Hill here and there, but don't expect any type of complex adventure which sets that series apart. The sounds are disturbing, with moans, groans, screams of torture, footsteps, clangs, electric shocks and much more, backed by a  wonderfully eerie music selection.<br />The gore in RON is generally over the top, though there are a few scenes which I found disturbing, and as for being scary? Well, at moments it actually can be! Go ahead, play it at night on a big screen with the lights out; raise the volume and make sure you don't have on dark clothes so the sensor can find you in the darkness. Now, don't tell me you won't feel tense as you turn each corner.  Not to mention, the game does have few jump scenes which were gladly welcomed. Perhaps those complaining about it not being scary should try not playing it with the sun shining into their room or at a dorm party with six drunk dudes.<br /><br />Self Control<br /><br />The controls seem to be an issue for some reviewers, yet according to the real audience, they're working out fine. Now and then, I had a bit of trouble backing up or turning - but for the most part,  I've been plowing through this horror ride, kicking all sorts of zombie flat butt without a problem.  If you're really stuck, you can use the auto icon by raising your right hand, allowing the game to walk for you. It won't help with encounters, but it aids in getting out of weird spots or when you're feeling disoriented. Your arm will tire quickly, which I feel is a good thing, otherwise, you'd be using it throughout the whole game..and come on,  that's no fun! The game uses check points, which sometimes can be a hassle when you've just made it past the wall to wall buzz saws, or a unhealthy large party of the undead; luckily, most check points are not painfully spaced. As for saving the game as in, I've had enough for tonight, well, that's done at the end of each chapter, so be sure to complete an entire chapter before hitting the eject.<br /><br />I'll trade you - my pocket knife for your machete.<br /><br />There are lots of weapons to find which is part of the fun, especially when the more devastating weapons come in to play. When you find something like an ice tong or chainsaw, you can't help thinking - oh man, they are SO dead now...well, dead for good this time. Think about this... instead of pressing a button the conventional way, you mimic the motions of actually holding one of these babies. Trust me, it's very satisfying, but you didn't read that here. Sadly, weapons wear down with use, so you've got to find a new one soon or you'll be fighting with your hands and feet. Speaking of feet, I love how the Kinect senses your foot as you kick a zombie down while preparing to slice and dice. It also gives you a second to breath while other zombies are lunging at you.<br /><br />Yeah, So?<br /><br />Overall, I'm loving Rise of Nightmares, though admittedly, I'm more of a fan of subtle creepiness over gore.  Sega's mature rated release is easily the most interactive on the Kinect yet, utilizing a host of clever, immersive gestures that help keep the game from feeling repetitive. Rise of Nightmares is what Kinect is all about, and hopefully, will pave the way to even grander scale games which will utilize this device in more innovative ways. Bravo for taking the risk, Sega!",

                "text": "As a gamer for many years (since the Atari 2600), I've experienced just about every form of entertainment technology, including today's high end tablets. A few months back, I was not even thinking about getting a Wii U. I saw the Gamepad and TV combination and thought, so what's the big deal about playing a game on the big screen, and having its map and inventory in your hand? And if you already have a tablet, then why bother  playing Wii U games on the supplied Gamepad?  Well, when you have one at home, it's a W H O L E different ball game.<br /><br />When you first get the unit, you do have to be patient as the system updates to the latest OS. This process can take a few hours as the file is large. No one told you to sit there and look at the screen, yet Nintendo came under fire from the media because consumers actually had to wait an extra few hours before they can start playing? Imagine that? How dare they update the system to add new features? Grant it, those should have been included before the release, but this happens with various forms of tech these days, just not a long! If you're a parent setting this up for your kid(s), I would suggest doing it while they're asleep, unless they are one of those rare, patient gems (if so, pat yourself on the back).<br /><br />The battery life on the GamePad is short - like three or four hours. I keep my charger cable nearby so I can still play while the pad is plugged in and charging , or periodically drop it on the cradle for a quick recharge while I take a break;  It's really no hassle at all! It's not like you're taking it outside anyway.  I have the screen brightness cranked at max which is visually pretty impressive by the way. It's no \"Retina\" display like an iPad, but it's still very sharp and a lot better than I expected!<br /><br />MiiVerse is amazing - like a huge on-line community which is tied into every form of media on the Wiiu. Play a game, press a button,  and switch to Miiverse to comment on it, or ask for tips! Then, jump right back to your game! Watch a YouTube video, and swap to Miiverse and you're in the YouTube discussion area. People can leave straight text messages, or use their stylus to hand write or DRAW a note; a lot of the sketch drawings submitted by users are amazing! MiiVerse alone is a very involving atmosphere that will keep you quite busy even without playing games. Sony's been trying to improve their similar social community known as \"Home\" for years, as for quite some time, it was not well received, yet, Nintendo's MiiVerse hits it out of the park at launch. The Browser for the WiiU is by far the best of the game console browsers - it's lightning fast, and works brilliantly to utilize both TV and GamePad. In addition, the GamePad can double as a TV/Cable Box remote which is ridiculously-easy to set up.  Come December, Wii U owners will be able to download TVii which will turn your Wii U GamePad into an excellent TV companion, with visual programming guide displayed on the GamePad,  including access to DVR controls.<br /><br />I've only played three games so far: NintendoLand, ZombiU and an Nano Assault Neo. NintendoLand is packed with mini games for solo and group play. I'm not going to go into details, but there are so many layers of things to discover, that it reminds me of the original Nintendo days! When you begin to play NintendoLand and see how the various games interact with the GamePad, you can't help but getting that technology RUSH! Where you suddenly realize how brilliant this system is and begin to imagine what's in store!  At that point, you're already looking for which game to buy next. You'll want to see what other games are like and how they work out with the GamePad. Most games can even be played directly on the GamePad, so if someone wants to use the TV, a quick finger touch switches the game to the small screen;  All intact, full speed ahead! You've heard of console quality gaming on a small screen - well, this is LITERAL!  I love how both displays can act independently, or show off the same information which you can flip between.  The Gamepad even has surround sound and a headphone jack!<br /><br />ZombiU is no doubt one of the scariest games you will ever experience. The atmosphere is so daunting, you'll be horrified to take the next step. The GamePad becomes your survival kit, with inventory manipulation, mapping via surveillance cameras a 360 degree, Augmented Reality-style scanner, and even voice navigation. There's a ton of functions UbiSoft intelligently incorporated into the GamePad.  Trust me, you play one evening of this and you'll know you're in a different league then the 360 and PS3. I own both units, and I still adore them, but already, Wii U takes the top spot for me.<br /><br />Nano Assault Neo the WiiU's answer to the PS3's lovely Super Stardust HD. Nano's  environments are amazingly-detailed, as you blast away the enemies in this twin stick delight. The Wii U's GamePad becomes  a live map showing the baddies swarming around, as well as locations of the  game's currency to purchase  upgrades. The acquired drones can be positioned and rotated for angle of fire right from your GamePad.  It's polished, arcade goodness backed by a fantastic techno soundtrack.  This was the first game I downloaded in the E-Shop. Next I'm going for Trine 2!<br /><br />There is SO much more to elaborate on,  as the WiiU has many other features to cover. After a few nights or learning the system, I've becomes more and more anxious to get home and play!  I've come to realize, all the negativity that is getting spewed are from people who simply don't own the machine. These are haters of anything that they don't own themselves, plain and simple. Then there's the irresponsible journalists,  who will induce head scratching as you wonder how they got their job. Many who have this need to fuel their articles with controversial quotes or useless top 10 ten this or 10 worst that ; they seem to get off finding even the most minute issues. Sure there are a few kinks for Nintendo to iron out, but it's only been out just over a week  (as of this review). Remember when the 360 and PS3 launched? BOTH systems had haters and whiners, along with visions of doom and gloom. Heck, the 360 even survived one of the highest defective rates (Red Ring of Death anyone?), and still came out on top after a number of years.<br /><br />Overall, I'm incredibly impressed and can't wait to see what the most creative developers do with the GamePad / TV combo. Plus, based on recent reports, this could be the Indi Game developers platform of choice which is a win-win situation!",

                "text": "I purchased this from an eBay member who secured a Day One Edition, which is why my review doesn't show as an Amazon verified purchase. The original buyer purchased it from Amazon back in June and had it delivered to me when I did a \"Buy it Now\" from Ebay. Well,  it turns out, I was one of the unlucky ones with the infamous,  faulty grinding drive; no games would load.I spent the first half of the evening mastering the voice commands, checking out game highlight uploads from the community, setting up the TV integration, and firing up a little Killer Instinct. Who knew, later in the evening this excitement would all come crashing down, when I tried to load up RYSE, only to discover my unit's disc player sounded like a paper shredder.<br /><br />I didn't want to deal with Microsoft and its complications to send back, so I simply looked up the order number that the original buyer provided me with and thankfully I was able to return it to Amazon as a gift (since i wasn't the original purchaser). Amazon is shooting out a replacement immediately. THE BAD NEWS: It's going to be the \"Standard\" version,  after paying a pretty penny (above list) for the Day One Edition.  The reason why I'm not giving this a one star review (as angry as I am) is because the console is too amazing not to get the stars it deserves. I also have the PS4 and I have to say, I like them equally for different reasons. I will say,the Xbox One does feel a bit more next gen thanks to the TV integration and the new Kinect, which makes the old one seem like a disposable camera from the 90's.<br /><br />Once you tweak the settings and spend a few hours learning the way of the console, you will have it at your demand using a pretty extensive library of voice commands. Yes, sometimes, I had to repeat myself, but for the most part, it works surprisingly well. As for gaming, there's not much I can do with a broken disc reader, but I'm already loving Killer Instinct with its insane, larger than life characters and sick amount of detail. It seems like the Xbox One can blast around graphics without breaking a sweat. The demo for Kinect Sports Rivas (the jet ski racing) looks like Wave Race on steroids with its gorgeous, vibrant visuals, and the level of control through the new Kinect is pretty impressive. I think having the new, advanced Kinect being standard will finally push motion control out of gimmickville and into welcomed arms. Oh, and dig into your apps and install this hidden gem called \"Xbox Fitness\". Gold members  will be in for a big surprise with this compilation of free work out programs that go as far reading your heartbeat. There's some pretty extensive workouts here which read your body sort of Dance Central-style, and even includes achievements among other great features. I'm surprised Microsoft didn't emphasize this great set of extras. Overall, I'm very excited about the future of this console (and the PS4).<br /><br />UPDATE: Got my replacement unit super fast (love love love you Amazon) and Microsoft is giving away a free XBOne game to all those who had a defective unit. Thank you for handling the situation very well, Microsoft.<br /><br />UPDATE: As for the big name titles, so far, I've only played Ryse: Son of Rome and my jaw has dropped below sea level. I've never seen such amazing character models in my life. This is no FMV nonsesne either! I love the extensive fighting techniques and stats tree that can be increased as you progress. The story is intriguing (not historical, though), and the acting is top notch. Despite the mediocre reviews, I am SO SO glad I generally never listen to game journalists. I am enjoying this game immensely, and I love the way it ties in with SmartGlass support on my iPad.  I've yet to play Dead Rising 3 and Forza - those are up next....",

The software available is a lot more innovative then the above mentioned, and set up is a breeze. The accuracy of the Move is dead on and super responsive and I love the way games can superimpose an item (hammer, torch, you name it) over the Move Controller, so when you're looking at yourself on screen via Eye, it really does look like you're holding that object. For FPS, you can't beat it - - check out BioShock Infinite and you'll understand.  More support for this, Sony!",

                "text": "Just finished off the 2.0 Avengers campaign. I have to say, it was a total blast from start to finish (no pun intended). The character sculpts are wonderful, and in game, Iron Man and Thor are the two you're going to play with the most. The Black Widow is fast with hand to hand combat, but she just doesn't have the same impact as the other two heroes. I must admit, however, building up her skill levels results in some very cool dual handed bullet bursts. This makes her one deadly force in the Power Disc game, Escape from Klyn.  In the main adventure,  Black Widow's disadvantage is that she can't fly,  so getting around New York City at decent pace requires a vehicle. Oh, they're readily available right from the start, but it kills the high energy flow when having to make pit stops to summon fast transportation. With Iron Man and Thor, you press a button, you levitate and another button sends you soaring at heart pumping speeds - - no wheels required. I can't comment on the other characters, as I haven't opened anything additional, but I'm getting ready to dive into Guardians of the Galaxy.<br /><br />Yes, there are TONS of enemy frost creatures on the Loki side of the fence, so get use to fighting the same type of icy cold enemy over and over (with variations in their sizes and abilities). Also, like the 1.0 edition, missions can feel repetitive at times.  This may bother some, but between the number of awesome moves, and the very welcomed Skill Tree, every fight felt like grand scale mayhem The insane abilities and special moves of your Super Hero are a sight to behold. Even the interaction with the surroundings is so well done. I also found the missions to be less frustrating then some of drawn out ones from 1.0 (except for Pirates which was my fav from that set).<br /><br />There is so much to do with the starter set, that you really feel like you're getting your money's worth. You have the main campaign, plus the two power discs, each containing their own full game. These power disc-based games  are of much smaller scale when compared to the main adventure, but believe me, both games are beefy enough to stand on their own. Interestingly enough, it appears there are two more games (as the menu shows)  ready for when Brave and Stitch are released. Plus you have the official  playsets that are sold separately ( Guardians of the Galaxy and Ultimate Superman).<br /><br />Then of course, all roads lead to the beloved Toy Box where you can do just about anything. Avalanche studios packed in an insane amount of new toys, gadgets, interiors (now you can build indoors), landscapes, skyboxes and more.  If you don't feel like you have the skills or time to build your own game, then download one of many offerings from the community. One of the best changes to the new 2.0 system is the way you obtain new objects from the Toy Box. Gone is that annoying,  random \"Wheel of Misfortune\" style toy dispenser where you had to rely on luck to get the item you needed; now you simply purchase items with blue sparks which are easily earned throughout your adventures. No more spending your life backtracking through a completed game to try to find toys you may have missed. Not all items are readily available, but as you make a purchase,  more goodies are unlocked through a branching system.<br /><br />There are a number of other areas I didn't cover (hall of heroes / Super heroes, survival mode, the game-like tutorial, etc..),  but overall, I say if you're a Marvel SH fan, this is the game you want. In fact, this makes the best use of the franchise yet!  You may find yourself addicted enough to start collecting all the characters, even the 1.0 cast, who work perfectly in the 2.0 ToyBox (they too have stats now!). And in closing, I'm of many fans who have a feeling that the next in the series will be Star wars (2015). Talk about a new hope!",

                "text": "(Purchased the Plush Edition which is why it's not showing as a Verified Purchase)<br /><br />Sumo Digital has taken Media Molecule's masterpiece to a whole new level. Right from the start, you can see how much brilliance they've added to this game. The challenging campaign is simply off the charts this time around, with so much going on, in every delicious layer. Trust me when I say, if you're a fan of the series your jaw will be on the floor the entire time. The new, crazy weapons, inventory-style system and quest objective list really transforms this into an grand scale adventure. Forget just platforming, wait until you see how many RPGS the community comes up with this time! Not to mention, a whole new array of shooters, puzzle, pinball, sports, and other games which will exceed anything created with the previous version (and those were superb!).<br />Check out the campaign maps which will remind you of moving from level to level in a Mario World game. I also love the fact that the game is backward compatible with just about everything,  including your already owned costumes and adventure packs.<br /><br />The music .. seriously  the best ever in the series. LBP 1 and 2 had their share of awesome tunes, but LBP 3 is a continuous treat to the ears. One level sports a brilliant Rock & Roll setting, which features licensed 50's-style music. I couldn't believe I was hearing \"Mr. Sandman\" while bouncing off walls (I'm old lol), and \"I only have eyes for you\" while drifting in and out of space. Oh, and don't even let me get started with Ziggurat, a Russian-themed level with an incredibly-kicking symphony (just found out it won awards).  You will be blown away both visually and audibly.<br /><br />Between the new characters, top down view, 16 layer depth and a monster load of new tools and other features (you'd need a book the size of War and Peace to list), you're going to be exploring and playing for a long time to come.<br /><br />One of the main draws to the Little Big Planet series is collecting as many of the tools, stickers, costumes, goodies, etc.. as you can find along your journey. There are gamers who just want to play, and not get involved with the building aspect. They'll race through all main story levels either solo or co-op, however, this will cut down their time spent to complete the campaign. Luckily, they have  thousands of community levels plus a number of official expansion packs to explore. If you're the creative type, and plan to build something of your own, you'll want to hit everywhere, including all the side games/missions. This will certainly make for one long, rewarding campaign. I've been playing for 10 hours and I'm just about to find the second new character. The joke of it is, I haven't even touched the community levels yet, which I expect to be mind boggling.<br /><br />Almost forgot to mention (thank you edit) -- just like the former LBP's,  there are numerous tutorial levels which introduce you to the main building tools/features, however, now it's called the \"Popit Academy\". This hybrid tutorial adventure combines  learning how to use the tools while playing through a good number of brilliant levels. You see, there's lots of fun to be had beyond the campaign! You'll want to stick with it as you'll earn lots of valuable items to fill that goodie bag. Early tutorial levels may set off a bit of restlessness with those well trained in the land of LBP , but nevertheless, they'll be hooked. Not to mention, vets can also skip the academy and head to the database of tutorials to watch instructional videos for the newer and advanced features.<br /><br />There are definitely a few quirks (as there are with most launch titles) that will surely be sewn up with patches (no pun). As I type this review, Sony has been doing a lot of behind the scenes maintenance as well.<br /><br />LBP2 was the only game I continuously played on my PS3, long after other games developed cobwebs, and LBP3 is the main reason I purchased my PS4!  You guys/gals at Sumo Digital are  magicians! Oh, by the way, wait until you unleash \"Oddsock\".....",

I absolutely love it -- it makes the colors even stand out more. Most of the 3DS games are well thought out, and I find more fun than those same ol' post apocalypse FPS that high end consoles are drowning in. The SNES theme is kind of cool, but I actually purchased it because of the price and color (when opened I like that gray purple combo of the original SNES system).

                "text": "Let me start by saying, I've had every Oculus under the sun. From the various developer versions, to the Rift Consumer.  Days before this review, I actually had the Quest! I was so excited, but in the end, I returned it for the Oculus S. Read on:<br /><br />First off, I found the Quest to be way too uncomfortable..  The all in one tech, means it has more hardware packed into the front than you PC powered headset, making it front heavy. I've read every suggestion and watched every video on how best to make it wearable, but nothing worked. I figured, OK, it's a trade off - I have no cords attached, isn't that alone amazing? Well, turns out, not really.  See, I started going on a \"Quest\" to compare games between my ol' Rift and the new kid on the block;  I tried Rec Room first. The frame rate on the Quest seemed good enough, but wait, why are the signs on the walls a bit blurry, and their edges, jagged? Maybe it was always like that but I never noticed? I walked up closely, and now they were super sharp. So now I'm looking at the play panel and notice, not every adventure is available yet (they will be coming though).  OK, I switch to my Rift, and load my Rec Room from the lovely Oculus Home (something the Quest doesn't have). First thing I noticed, the colors weren't as vibrant as on Quest, and yeah, there's that screen door effect which is more noticable. But hold on! All those same signs, from the same distance are not blurry or jagged? I realized, that's how they compensated on the Quest as it's not as powerful as a high end PC.<br /><br />Now I switch to Robo Recall. On the Quest, it looks really good, but now what's this? Something doesn't feel right. The shooting just feels a bit off.  The frame rate seems to struggle at certain points. I switch back to the Rift version, and now things are how I remembered - super fast and every action you pull off is instantaneous. Next up VR Chat. The Quest version looks good - the frame rate is not a problem. Someone informs me that not every avatar will show up on the Quest due to the hardware limitation.  At this point, I've beginning to have second thoughts. I was planning to sell off my Rift and just stay Quest, but I feel the link cable may not be the answer, at least for me. I don't want any shortcomings, and I want my entire Steam Library to work as well as my Oculus Store games.  My battery is beginning to get low... and so is my enthusiasm.<br /><br />This is what made me decide on switching it out for an Oculus S. My laptop is a powerhouse, and it has a mini displayport, so I was set. Hook up was super simple. The S was instantly recognized, and my Oculus Home loaded up with all my previous purchases. The Screen... killer!  Much sharper than the Rift. but the black level is not as black as the Quest (another beautiful screen), as the Quest uses OLED. I went back to the Rift,  still plugged into my desktop computer. It seemed so washed out and almost blurry compared to the Rift S.<br /><br />As for Rift S sound, it exactly like the Quest...firing out of the headband,  and like zero bass. Good not terrible. The Rift's built in awesome headset will be missed.  Still, I can always plug in my own, even better than old Rift headphones.  Problem solved. As for comfortability.... perfect! Oh my goodness, it actually beats out the original Rift which I always considered the most comfortable (I also had the original Vive which was a head's worst enemy).  The S uses the \"Halo\" system, similar to Playstation VR, but even more comfortable.<br /><br />Yeah, I have one long cord attached to my headset, but I don't mind. If I kept the Quest and went for the link cable, I'll be back to where I started anyway.  No sensors taking up space, and awesome full room+ scale.  So now, I have all my Oculus Store games, along with my Steam VR purchases, without any sacrifices,  limits or coming soons.  I finally can put the original Rift up for sale. I'm super satisfied and quite blown away.<br /><br />A final note: If your PC is now powerful enough, than the Quest is a no-brainer. It's an amazing accomplishment. If it's your first VR,  and not coming from a high end PC experience to compare, you'll love it. If you have a high end gaming PC, then I would totally go for the Rift S,  as you will get the whole nine yards, without compromise.",

                "text": "UPDATE:  Two Years Later My Son and I Both Revisit These Games Frequently ENough to Make This One of the Best Values Ever for a Pokemon Game<br /><br />Original Review:  I have been playing these games with my now-10-year-old son since he was three (I bought used GBCs and color pokemon games and let him figure it out - he also learned to read). Together, we have gone through the Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, the Sinnoh games, and Heart Gold/Soul Silver. I almost didn't buy a copy of Pokemon Black, because the games had been getting kind of stale for me. My son still loves them (as do his classmates - if you have a fourth grade boy on your gift list, and he doesn't already have this? You will be making a little boy ecstatic.<br /><br />Anyway, my son really wanted me to play, and I gave in a bit reluctantly, but, now that I'm playing the game, I love this iteration for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I do not want to spoil the storyline, but the antagonists' issues and ethical positions are fairly sophisticated. Team Plasma is actually asking some interesting questions about trainers' relationships with their pokemon. Those questions also apply to our own relationships with other (real) creatures here in our world.<br /><br />2. The smack-talk from rivals and other trainers is toned way down from generations past.<br /><br />3. The game helps you along, which makes it much less frustrating (at least for me). For example, before each of the three gym battles I've done so far, you get an opportunity to get a pokemon who has a helpful type and a high enough level to ensure that you don't spend a ton of time fighting and re-fighting the same battles.<br /><br />4. The graphics are really amazing for a handheld game, and the towns have lots to do besides gym battling, so your kid isn't likely to beat this game in a day and toss it aside. You get your money's worth.<br /><br />5. There are new battle modes, new pokemon, new ways of interacting with friends in person and over the Wifi Connection. Nintendo also made Black and White just different enough from each other to make it worthwhile to purchase and play both.<br /><br />I deducted one star because my game cartridge arrived glitchy. In the first battle, my pokemon, a female Oshawott could not execute any attacks. Every time I selected an attack, the game went to a screen describing the attack and showing my trainer statistics. I had to shut down the game and restart several times, all with the same result (except never again did I get a female starter), before I decided to try cleaning the cartridge, which worked (use a q-tip and rubbing alcohol gently to clean the game cartridge and let it dry completely). This is the first time since the Gameboy color games (which I bought used) that I have had a quality control issue with a pokemon game.<br /><br />I recommend this game for kids who enjoy the anime and the other rpg and for adults who either want to play along with their children or enjoy gentle (mostly) nature/environmental-themed rpgs. It's fun and has good replay value for the money.",

                "text": "I have SLE with mobility issues (inflammatory arthritis) and chronic fatigue, which puts me in a catch 22 situation of needing to exercise to keep from losing ground with both my mobility and my stamina, while having to fight an uphill battle just to get to the point that I CAN exercise.  Going to a gym with any kind of regularity is out of the question.  I used to be really active before I got sick, and I much prefer doing \"something\" to jogging on a trampoline or working through a list of exercises from my physical therapist.  So I thought I would give this a try.<br /><br />I love love love it.  Unlike the Wii Fit game, your mii doesn't shame you over a one star performance (okay, I think that's funny, but your mother or your grandmother might not).  Also, Just Dance makes it extremely easy to start from right where you are, mobility-wise.  You can start sitting down, if you need to.<br /><br />The game is also very flexible in terms of how you structure your sessions.  You can use the Just Dance feature to browse through songs and move to what you like to hear or to learn the moves (which actually seems to be helping with my cognitive function) to the dance routines you like the best.  If you're just looking to get in, get some cardio, and get out, you can go into the Just Sweat section and do that.  You can even set weekly goals for yourself.<br /><br />My favorite part about the game is that it is so low key and hassle free.  You turn it on, and get right to whatever you want to do.  When you are finished, it's fast and easy to shut the thing down.  The songs are eclectic (some content might not be appropriate for young children), and replay value is high.  I like it so much that I got Just Dance 4 for Wii U.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't always record your movement correctly or save your progress.  It's no mean feat for me to hit my daily goal, so when I go back the next day after meeting my daily objective and the last dance I did didn't get its points saved, it's a bit of a disappointment.  Not a super big deal, though.  I'm not exactly getting graded or paid by the point : )",

I will never be able to do all the moves, but I have a really good time doing what I can.  The Just Sweat mode is a lot harder than it was on Just Dance 3.  Instead of being able to pick a goal and then pick your way through the songs you like, this one has you commit to an amount of time (up to 45 minutes, give or take) and pick a style (cheerleader, martial arts, salsa, etc.) and then it blasts you through alternating dance sessions and workout sessions (dance - kick box - dance - kick box - like that).  It's more like a traditional work out video in that respect.<br /><br />As for the Just Dance function, I have arthritis in my hips and spine, so, as I stated above, I cannot do all of the moves.  But you can get through the Wii U version of this game without being able to do all of the steps as long as you can do a pretty good approximation of the arm stuff.  And it's really fun, even for an old geezer like me.<br /><br />My 12 year old son refuses to play it with me.  He's pretty mortified at the very thought that I *dance* *at* *all* - so watching me do it isn't high on his to do list.  He's also kind of a little rock snob, and this game does seem to have an even higher concentration of dance-y, disco-y new music than Just Dance 3 had, so I probably wouldn't recommend this as a gift for the little metalhead in your life - stick with Rock Band for that one.  I still highly recommend it for anyone who needs to exercise but gets bored easily.<br /><br />P.S.  There's no training mode for this game and no way to back up in the middle of a song.  If you want to practice/learn the steps, and you're slow like me, you can go to youtube and search for videos.  Watch them and rewind to your heart's content.  Then, pop in your game and head to town.",

When the K66, my first question was whether it was a better deal than the more expensive (by about 50% of the price of this one) K70. If that's what you are wondering, too, my answer is yes. Everything, from the cable to the material of the keyboard itself, is of better, more durable qualiity on the K70. It's metal where the 66 is plastic. The cable on the 70 is nearly twice as thick and wrapped in braided fabric, rather than plastic. The K70 also comes with special gaming keys and a tool to swap them in or out. My son is thrilled with the K70, and if what you want is primarily a gaming keyboard, I strongly suggest that one over this one.<br /><br />However, that's far from the whole story on the K66. If you want to game sometimes, but also use your computer for working and/or writing, I like the K66 better. Its action is lighter and quieter. It's also faster. And, yes, it's plastic, but it is still super nice. I get tired trying to type on a laptop, especially if I have to enter numbers. The K66 is a dream for typing - much like the old Mac keyboards: fast, precise, with no ghosting. It doesn't come with a wrist rest, so you will need to buy one separately if you use one. Recommend for typing/light gaming. For heavy gaming, check out the K70.",

I can't go to the gym or walk very far. So, with the buyer's market, I decided to get a Kinect and some exercise. The game that comes with it is perfect for an older, mobility-challenged person. It got me moving just enough without feeling like I was going to fall or have to stop. There are breaks between levels (this is especially good if you are older - sustained cardio is not as good for us as it is for younger people - at least according to the emails I get from various web-info-mercials I have clicked on).<br /><br />You don't need a lot of room to do the game, and much of it can be done in a chair.

It's also more convenient to use the in-line volume control and mute.<br /><br />Basically, the question is going to be whether you want pc-gaming and, if not, whether you want to pay an extra thirty bucks for slightly better sound and a removable mic. Really, if you are looking to spend more money, you can do a lot better by spending more than just the thirty bucks to get up to the Cloud Core.<br /><br />I recommend this headset if you're looking for something inexpensive.",

Even with arthritis and mobility issues in my hands, when I need accuracy, I need tactile feedback and no ghost presses ever. I have been using two corsairs. One is a k70 with cherry MX speed switches. I ended up giving it to my son, who plays a lot of PC games with it and loves it. The other is a k66 with cherry mx red switches. It's slower and louder than the k70, but it's also a lot less expensive and great for touch typing.<br /><br />This G513 has a lot of features that make it nicer in some ways than the K70 - the memory foam wrist rest is really comfortable. The GX blue switches are faster and lighter (or it seems that way) than the mx cherry speed switches. They do not lack for tactile feedback, though, so I don't lose accuracy when I need it most. I let my son try gaming on it, and he liked it better than the k70. However, when I asked which he thought was the better value, he said the k70.<br /><br />So, bottom line is that if you're a gaming enthusiast whose budget is limited, you may not need to go with this. I don't have experience with the really really expensive keyboards to tell you whether those are worth the money to, like, competitive gamers. But for someone who plays for fun, I think this one is worth the money if you have it. Otherwise, go for the k70.",

I didn't want its beautiful purple exterior scratched more so I decided to buy this skin.<br /><br />This was the first time I ever tried ordering this sort of gadget protection. After ogling at the prettiness of the box it came in, I buckled down and started aligning pieces. The instruction videos made it look so easy, I swear! The hardest part of the installation were the flat surfaces that angle down a bit at the edges. All I remembered was a lot of frustration, a lot of pressing slippery pieces into place and a lot of application fluid. Proly just a noob thing, but eventually I got the hang of it, how much fluid to spray on and all then, and the rest of the installation went smoothly. Not a perfect job on my end, but GOOD ENOUGH.<br /><br />Proly took a few hours to do all this.<br /><br />I still have a few pieces left as I only needed the exterior of my 3DS covered. I kinda futzed around with the pieces on the hinges, but what they said about imperfections was true, you can hardly notice bubbles, and residue when it's fully dried.<br /><br />I love the feel of the plastic film, I can really say that my 3DS is fully protected now thanks to Skinomi :D",

I find the clacking of the switches really satisfying.  The RGB colors are nice.  Can't really tell any difference though in game performance vs a membrane keyboard.",

Each interaction is the same repetitive thing. I can either Dance or call them a Chicken! It gets boring really quick. I liked the old wheel where I could choose my emote that I wanted to do for that interaction. It made the game more entertaining.<br /><br />The property ownership is very annoying when it comes to houses. You have to repair them from time to time and there isn't an easy way to find what you need to repair. You basically have to sit down and look at the map in each town looking for run down houses to repair.<br /><br />Ultimately I found the game frustrating and boring. I won't be buying Fable 4.",

I'd have to say that this system is wonderful! I like everything about it. It's sleek, runs quiet, and pumps out an amazing picture (I\"m only using a 26\" LCD that supports 720p Picture resolution.) I'm a little disappointed that it won't play PS2 games, but I still have that system laying around. No complaints so far!<br /><br />Update: 10/2/09<br />My system gets moderate to heavy use. Mostly as a DVD/Blu Ray player, though I've been playing way more games on it now that I have more time. It's still going strong. I recently upgraded from the stock 80gb hard drive to a 500gb one. The upgrade only took a bit of reading, and a couple hours of time (mostly for system back up and system restore... actual physical labor was about 5 minutes of work...) Over the past year, I've dabbled with the multimedia features as well as many of the fun miscellaneous things the PlayStation Network provides.<br /><br />Over all, I consider this a must-have system for anyone who wants a complete media center. This will store/play all your music, play all your movies and even work as a PC if you install Linux (my next project, actually.) My only complaint about it is still the lack of PS2 support on this model. I'm hoping for Sony to get their act together and release software emulation via the PlayStation Store... I'd be willing to kick them some bucks for the convenience of playing my favorite PS2 games without having to dig up my old systems.<br /><br />Update:  1/17/11<br />System's still going strong!  I've finished several games, and my TV has been upgraded to a 50\" HDTV, and the picture is amazing!  That whole support for Other OS went the way of the warrior a while back, so those hopes were dashed.  I still stand by the 5 star rating, however.  The game catalog keeps improving, and the fact that I can stream Netflix and watch Blue Ray discs on it keeps it in the game.

Everything seems very fluid, and over all, I'm having a blast!<br /><br />Previous Impression:<br />I'm seeing some negative reviews on this, and I'm rather surprised.  This game pretty much delivers what's advertised.  When I saw the initial trailers, I expected a clone of Diablo/Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, and that's exactly what you get.  The graphics and sound are far sharper than it's predecessors, and the play control is solid.  I'm about 5 or 6 hours into the single player game as Lucas.  The story is fine enough (these types of games never have mind-blowing story lines anyway) and the characters are about what you'd expect.

Granted, it's a bit short, but there is some replay value here (thank the Trophy system for that.)  I'd expect the average person to play through it in about 10 hours.  Some grinding will be necessary if you want an easier time with the end.  Trying to complete the game when you're in your low-mid 20's can be tough for some.

I was hoping for parties of characters that shared colorful banter.  This game isn't that, but that's not necessarily a bad thing!  Even though this game is rather old, it still holds up, in my opinion!  Yeah, the graphics are a bit dated, but they still look nice. The game play is a mix between Baldur's Gate style games, and Diablo.  It's a top-down dungeon crawl with a bit more menu to work with.  Combat will be a bit slower than Diablo, and you pay more attention to detail in this game than you would in say Baldur's Gate (you only have one character to deal with, not 6.)  I've only played through the main campaigns, and here's my summary of them:<br /><br />NWN:  The game is fine enough, as the story line is only fairly interesting.  The game-play is where this one shines, though!  I found the combat in this game to be very fun.  I played through most of the game as a rogue, then all the way through as a paladin.  You only get one side character at a time, and each one has a little bit of story.  Basically, take one with you and do some adventuring.  As time goes on, they'll fill you in on their past and ask you to do a favor for them.  Once it's complete, they will reward you with a magical item that'll prove fairly useful.  As the game progresses, these trinkets can be upgraded.  My personal favorite character was the halfling rogue.  His story was the most interesting, and his skills can be very useful.  The cleric wastes all her magic on destroying undead, so I found playing through the as a paladin and taking the rogue with me whenever possible was the best for me.  This portion of the game gets a solid 4 stars from me.<br /><br />SoU:  This expansion basically serves as an interlude to get you form the previous to the next.  The story was only OK, and there wasn't much new added to the game-play (though you lose karma in this title if you use the rogue to pick locks!)  If I recall correctly, you get some ability to control your NPC's inventory, which is nice.  I mostly took the dwarf rogue with me through this portion.  None of the NPC's really had my interest for long.  She took care of traps for me, and that was enough.  This part only got 3 stars in my book...<br /><br />HoU:  This expansion was AMAZING for me.  Going through the Underdark is a lot of fun, and you get a wopping 2 NPC's at a time.  YES!  THERE IS BANTER!  The kobold bard from the previous title (was pretty annoying then) follows you through out.  He's pretty much comic relief.  I really enjoyed the story and the characters here.  I think there might have been a slight graphical upgrade too.  Also, there is a way to customize your gear, so you can make your awesome magical gear even more awesome!  5 stars!  It's pretty awesome!<br /><br />One day I'll get to King Maker and some of the other modules.  If so, I'll be sure to edit this post with my input!",

In fact, I think it's pretty damn good.  Aside from the facial features of the characters during conversations, the graphics are amazing.  The music is very nice, though it seems to be a bit off queue at times (not often, but enough to warrant me mentioning it.)  Over all, the game play is good. Combat seems pretty smooth, and it can be a challenge at times.<br /><br />There are some bugs in it, though.  For example, when I first came across the Judge in her office, Alex was floating in the air while they were having a conversation (his feet were about the same level as the top of her desk!)  The biggest problem I have with the game is the lack of save-points.  They are too few and the distance between them is substantial.  Unless you're using a guide, or have played through the game before (or fairly lucky/fast at playing,) the exploratory nature of the game makes it so you can expect a good 45 minutes to an hour between saves.  The challenge of the game steadily increases, and losing an hour of play can be demoralizing to some.  The story is good enough to keep me going back for more though (the nurses in the Grand Hotel ate me alive for a while there!)<br /><br />Advice for those playing through for their firs time:  Save as much as you can, and make multiple save-files. Otherwise you might find yourself starting over because you used up all your ammo or recovery items a few hours in.  Coming up with some solid tactics can save you a fair amount of grief later in the game.<br /><br />Over all, this is a very welcome addition to the Silent Hill series, as well as the Survival Horror genre in general!",

I've had several issues with bugs from Bethesda's titles in the past.  Morrowind and Oblivion, while some of my favorite games, were a nightmare to start up because of some of the bugs.  Fallout 3 was notorious for crashing my PS3 (especially the expansion material.)<br /><br />Well, recently started this game, and I'm several hours into it.  So far, I haven't run across a single bug (that couldn't be killed by my machete.)  The story is pretty good.  Good enough for a sandbox game.  I'd say the graphics feel cleaner and smoother than Fallout 3's.  The voice acting is at least as good as Fallout 3's, and I love the music -  The fine folks at Obsidian did an amazing job with integrating the music!  It really feels like \"The Wild, Wild West!\"<br /><br />I'd also like  to take the time to point out the improvements of the skill system.  Having a repair skill doesn't just allow you to fix up your weapons.  It allows you to convert ammo you don't use into ammo that you do use!  I really like how the speech and barter skills have been beefed up:  Instead of your skill level giving you a % chance of succeeding, they put a quota - A dialog option, for example, will say [Speech 25] and if you have a 25 or higher, you automatically succeed!  Survival is also a very useful skill now.  Having higher ranks of the skill will allow you to cook food and make some equipment.<br /><br />The perks you can chose from at the start aren't that great (Wild West was the only one that didn't have ridiculous negative effects on you.)  Once you start leveling up, the perks that become available are quite nice.<br /><br />Over all, I really like this game!",

The game play is remarkably fluid, and I really love the graphics and the music.  The voice acting, for the most part, is top notch.  One thing that really draws me in is that combat isn't exactly forced on you.  Sometimes it's easier to simply take out the thugs.  Other times, moving a box and exposing a vent shaft will take you around them.  When it does come to combat, it seems pretty well done.  I'm terrible at FPS type games, but I seem to hold my own here (I am playing on \"Tell Me A Story...\"  I admit, I'm lame in that sense!)  Ultimately, this feels like a role playing game with a FPS twist.  You're not going to get a lot of sandboxing here like you would in Fallout or Oblivion, as the world you're in feels a bit smaller.  Don't get me wrong, there is some exploring to be done but not as much as the other titles mentioned.<br /><br />The level-up system is also nice, and leaves a lot of room for customization.  It seems like you really can't go wrong with whatever build you take.  It also allows you to focus more on stealth, or combat too, if you so desire.  Experience is given by completion of quest, as well as for kills and take-downs.  Yes, you have plenty of quests available!  Once  you complete the first mission (after the introductory mission,) you'll be given several side quests, as well as \"main quests\" that push the story forward.<br /><br />Another really nice feature:  I've noticed no bugs!  Granted, I try to get from point A to point B asap, and haven't seen everything I could.  Over all, I highly recommend this title!",

                "text": "I've been following the Dragon Quest series since the original was released for the NES (I got mine for free with a Nintendo Power subscription!)  Needless to say, I'm a huge fan.  When this game got announced for the DS, I was extremely excited.  I pre-ordered it, and couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  Well, I got it, played it some, and then I let it sit.  Over the past several months, I've picked it up here and there.  I'll play it in fits-and-starts.  Ultimately, I can't bring myself to really play it.  Sure, the graphics are very polished and nice, and I love the music (just like any other title from the series!)  There are also some bright spots scattered here and there too.  The game, however, feels like that the people behind this game wanted to make a game that would last a long time.  Well, they succeeded with quantity over quality.  The most important feature of any RPG is story, and with DQ9, we're being told a story that's only OK. I can deal with a story that's only OK, if the game has engaging game-play.  But we don't even have that here!  What we did get was an annoying level-up/jobs system, a mess of tedious side quests and forced grinding.  Let me fill in some details here:<br /><br />Level Up System --  It takes a lot of XP to level up as you move through the game if you stick with one class.  Sure, you can switch classes and knock out a few easy levels and get some skill points, but the best skills come at higher levels.  Trying to make an uber-character can take too much time and research.  When playing a Dragon Quest game, I kind of just want to move through the story.<br /><br />Side Quests --  You'll run across some NPC's with blue-colored conversation balloons over their heads.  These folk have side quests that you can complete.  Unfortunately, many of them are of the form \"go kill X number of enemy Y using tactic Z.\"  These tactics used seem to be the most annoying way to fight (go kill them with an under-powered skill, or weak weapon, for example.)  Some of these side quests are required if you'd like to train a character in a particular job, which is unfortunate.  Others have rewards that don't mean nearly as much to the game, and are there for our amusement (or in my case, annoyance.)<br /><br />Characters --  You recruit a party of generic members in this game, very much like you did in DQ3.  It was fine back then, as personality had no role what-so-ever in the first few Dragon Quest titles.  But once they hit DQ4, characters with at least a smidgen of personality were introduced.  Here, we get customized sprites.  They simply follow you around and follow orders.<br /><br />This game did have some interesting ideas behind it.  The combo-system is neat when you can get it to work.  I also like how the characters appearance change when you equip different things (even if the new look was sometimes awful!)  Running around and NOT having random encounters is a huge plus for me.  In fact, random encounters can ruin my taste for a game sometimes.  With DQ9, you almost always know when a fight will take place!<br /><br />So is this game terrible?  No.  I've certainly played worse.  But I do think it might be the worst of the series!  I expect some level of grinding with any Dragon Quest (or RPG) title.  It's kind of the nature of the beast here.  We're kind of forced into a grind here, though, and it really detracts from the game.  Especially when the story is rather weak!  (The story actually had an interesting start, but became a lather-rinse-repeat throughout.)  I'm sure fans of the series will appreciate the game on some level.  In the end, I found some appreciation for the parts that I played.  But it's not on my \"I need to finish this\" list.  I may get around to it, but not any time soon.",

                "text": "I've been a fan of The Elder Scrolls since Morrowind, and I was quite excited for this release.  I must admit, that between the issues I had with finally getting Oblivion to run, and what I heard about Fallout: New Vegas (I fortunately didn't have time to play that one right away,) I was nervous that Bethesda would release yet another title with game-breaking bugs.  Well, I haven't had any problems thus far (several hours of play so far.)  What I have noticed is how much they improved the system!  It looks to me like they borrowed heavily from the recent Fallout titles.  My review will be focusing on the mechanical aspects of the game:<br /><br />*Skills and leveling seem less obtuse.  They got rid of the stats, so you have more freedom to decide which skills you level.  You no longer have to worry about the age-old TES question \"Should I tag that skill?  Or will it cripple my character?\"  They also removed the \"you must rest in order to level up\" requirement, which is a bit more convenient.<br /><br />*The crafting system seems to borrow heavily  from Fallout: New Vegas (and games like World of Warcraft.)  You no longer need to carry repair hammers around.  Instead, you find raw materials and instead of maintaining your equipment, you can improve it.  Over all, this makes the skills feel more useful, and at the same time, it seems that it reduces the tedium (stopping in the middle of a dungeon to repair my damn boots in Morrowind/Oblivion was always annoying!)<br /><br />*Questing has improved!  The quest log is far easier to follow than it has been in previous titles.<br /><br />*Combat hasn't changed too much, though they added the ability to equip a weapon in your offhand.  Getting the rhythm down to fight this way takes a little time, but it's a welcome change!<br /><br />*The voice-acting is immensely better than it was in Oblivion!  The towns feel more fleshed out this time around.<br /><br />*Of course the graphics have improved.  TES series seems to have always been on par or ahead of the rest when it comes to visuals.  And consistently with the previous titles, the music is still great!<br /><br />*The men in this game are so manly that they don't wear coats!  EVEN WHEN STANDING AROUND WAITING TO MUG YOU ON A SNOWY MOUNTAIN!<br /><br />A word of advice:  Leave the giants alone!<br /><br />Update (1/7/12)<br /><br />Still adding on hours to the game, and I haven't ran into anything game-breaking.  Every now and then the game will threaten to lock up, but I don't think I had to ever reset my console.  Also, I haven't had too many problems with quests, which seems to be a common complaint from other users.  Again, I've played other Bethesda titles, and I think dodging some of the big glitches is the luck-of-the-draw; I've had attempts at Oblivion and Morrowind that stalled within the first few hours, and I've also had complete play-throughs with very few hang-ups.<br /><br />Update (4/3/12)<br /><br />Still playing this game from time to time!  And I still haven't run into many serous glitches.  A few graphical errors, and that's about it.  If I play for a long time, the game seems to get a little fussy (and it may be because of heat issues with the PS3 itself.)  There are still many areas to explore, and tons of quests to complete, so I haven't tested everything yet (even after all this time!)  Skyrim still has my highest recommendation!  In fact, with respect to my experiences, it's probably the most stable game Bethesda has released to date, and every bit as fun as the previous titles!",

                "text": "When the Nintendo DS was announced, I didn't think much of the touchscreen.  I even waited until the release of the DS Lite before I jumped on that bandwagon.  Even now, I never use the touch screen on it.  When the PlayStation Vita was announced, I had a different mindset.  Touchscreen technology seems to have improved immensely since it was introduced in cellphones and tablets.  Sony also had me very curious about the touch-sensitive back panel (and VERY happy that this system had 2 analog control sticks!)  I was also rather impressed by the hardware specs...  This little machine is a BEAST!  Over all, I am really happy with my purchase, and I'll be happy to fill in the details why.  There are also a few gripes (nothing worth docking a star, but worth mentioning,) that I have as well.<br /><br />At any rate, I finally picked one up, and have had a few days to mess with it.  The set-up was fairly intuitive, and I had to deal with an update, but that took about 5 minutes to download and install, so no harm there!  I avoided buying any games at the store.  I decided that I'll stick mainly with the PSN for purchasing my games, and with that in mind, I went with the moderately sized 8GB memory card, in hopes that the prices of those come down by the time it fills up.  The first 2 games that I picked up for the PS Vita were Touch My Katamari and Super Stardust.  I was a fan of the previous installments of these games, both were relatively cheap, and seemed like they'd make decent use of the new interfaces (which they did!)  The graphics and sound pumped out on this thing really are top notch.  The controls work perfectly, and having the second analog stick really is necessary for most modern games.  Some reviewers mention that the analog sticks are way too sensitive.  I had absolutely no issues with them.  The buttons are very responsive, and have nice tactile response.  The touchscreen is probably the best I've ever used, and I really like the implementation of the rear touch panel, though I'm still getting used to it.<br /><br />When it comes to some of the more physical features, I'm largely satisfied as well.  Some reviewers mention how big it is, as if they're almost disappointed (though I haven't read any that said that it's so big that it detracts from the experience.)  For me, the size is fine, as I've never been one to take my portables everywhere I go.  In fact, I appreciate the fact that it's larger than the PSP!  You get way more screen real estate! (For the record, I mainly keep them at home, or take them with me when I travel.  I've never been one to cart these to work/school!)  Battery life is sufficiently long, especially considering what's under the hood!  I was actually surprised that the PS Vita lasts so long, and is still pretty light weight.<br /><br />The launch lineup is relatively sparse, but that always seems to be the case with a new console.  I looking forward to a few of the titles that'll be hitting this year:  Silent Hill will have a PS Vita release, and Final Fantasy X will be revamped in HD, and released for the Vita (as well as PS3.)  The system seems to be a hit thus far, so I imagine that developers will be drawn to it, and the list of titles will bulk up soon enough!<br /><br />As I mentioned before, I do have a few nitpicks.  Since I'm used to Sony, I expected these, and I'm willing to deal with them, but these are some issues I'd like to see changed:<br /><br />*No internal storage, and VERY expensive proprietary (Sony Brand-only) memory card options is a bit on the absurd side.  It would make sense that this machine should have enough memory internally to at least handle software updates, game saves and apps that you'd always want access to, like Netflix (this app does have a decent interface, by the way, and while a bit on the small side for long viewing stints, the picture is nice!)  Flash-based memory isn't that expensive, and something like 4GB wouldn't cost them much to install, nor would it take up much room inside.  I get why Sony is trying to lock their cards, but damn...  they're a bit harsh on the wallet!  If there was a rating for \"Affordability,\" the system would definitely lose a star.  But this doesn't affect the over-all quality, nor does it make the games any less fun, so I will stay at 5 stars.<br /><br />*While I like the rear touch panel, it does get in my way at times.  I tend to hold my handheld systems with my fingers stretched across the back of the unit.  I find black holes popping up randomly in Super Stardust, and my Katamari seems to get stretched out randomly.  I'm sure that I'll get used to it, but for now, it's a minor annoyance.<br /><br />*The lack of PlayStation Classics support upon launch is a bummer, but Sony says that they'll add that in once it's ready.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm very pleased with my purchase!",

There's not enough room to fit the charger in along with the PS Vita, which doesn't make this very useful for traveling.

It'll keep your system protected from scratches, and might help if you're going to keep it in a backpack, but over all, this doesn't feel all that protective.<br /><br />This case is functional, and since there aren't a lot of options out there, I guess it'll do for now.

I own the PS3 version, and had a lot of fun with it.  This one is the same game, with some added tweaks.  Don't expect anything more as far as story!  The quests and main plot are all the same.  They did add several new features when it comes to game play, however.  You have more control over the faeries, and they made good use of the touch capabilities of the Vita.  It also seems that this version has WAY more trophies.  For players that want to pad their trophy catalog, I suppose this'd be a good place to invest your money (in a few hours time, I think I racked up between 10 and 15...)<br /><br />I noticed that this game has been receiving a lot of poor reviews, and I'm surprised by this.  DH:A is a dungeon crawl.  You kill lots of things, and get lots of loot.  Lather-rinse-repeat.  In fact, it does a pretty good job at doing it's job.  If you enjoy these sorts of games (Diablo, Torchlight, Dungeon Siege, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, etc...) you should be right at home here.<br /><br />As far as technical aspects, the game fits the bill just fine.  Play control is fluid, and sound/graphics, while not cutting edge, are perfectly serviceable.  Again, I like how they added in some additional controls with the Vita's touch screen/rear touch panel, and how they added some additional game play features.<br /><br />The only criticism that I really have is that it has a rather steep price tag, especially considering that the original version was less than half the cost (I think I paid $10 or so when it was on sale with my PlayStation Plus membership.)  This game is a lot of fun, and I find that it's worth what I paid.  It's very nice to have this one available while on-the-go!<br /><br />**Edit:  I recently compared the PS Vita game to the PS3 version, and this one actually seems to run more smoothly.

Though this game gets great reviews, it didn't seem to make much of a splash when it hit the shelves.  I pre-ordered it, and finally got the time to fire it up.  If I were to compare it to other games, it seems like it's closer to Fable or Nier, than it is to other RPG's like The Elder Scrolls or Final Fantasy.<br /><br />***Sound, Graphics and Technical Stuff***<br />The graphics in this game remind me a bit of WoW - not so much as a direct copy - just in spirit!  You'll see lots of vivid colors and a slight cartooniness throughout the game.  The voice acting is top notch, though the lip syncing leaves a little to be desired (no real bearing on the over all quality, though!)  KoA: Reckoning also feels fairly polished.  The frame-rates are largely stable, and I haven't dealt with any crashes or glitches.<br /><br />Those interested in padding their trophy list will be happy - I think there are 100 or so available in KoA: Reckoning.  Many of which are awarded just for playing a game (and might be hidden.)<br /><br />***Game Play and RPG Elements***<br />So far, the story has my attention, and I'm eager to see what happens next.  The side quests are numerous and for the most part, rather interesting.  Right off the bat in games like Skyrim, Oblivion or Fallout, I often feel overwhelmed.  This feeling frequently stays for the first several hours of play time.  Kingdom of Amalur, on the other hand, feels quite welcoming as soon as you start!  Things aren't nearly as forced as they are in say a Final Fantasy game, but not being as open as the more sandboxy titles is actually a welcome change of pace!<br /><br />Questing feels almost exactly like it did in WoW.  They even highlight quest-givers with yellow \"!\" and \"?\" when they have a quest to give or receive.  If you're not familiar with these, let me sum it up:  The world of Amalur, or whatever they call it, is filled with lazy and weak people that make you do their bidding.  The quests consist of target hunts, gathering of items/goods, acquiring goods (like make potion X or buy item Y, and bring it back,) and clear dungeon Z.  Rewards are given in experience points, and often money/items.<br /><br />I really like the way you can custom-build your character, and not feel pressure (you can redo your \"spec,\" if you wish!)  The crafting system is also nice - simple,  yet effective.  Combat is also nicely done here.  There is enough button-pushing to make you feel engaged the whole time, but not overly done, like they do in some other Action RPG's.  Leveling up is easy enough in this game.  As I mentioned before, quests grant experience, as does combat and finding various things (stones, hidden treasures, etc) while exploring and opening locked chests.<br /><br />The crafting system is simplified enough to not be confusing.  You can salvage your weapons and armor, which provides you with parts to make new things.  Relying on only salvaging, however, is a crap-shoot.  After salvaging countless weapons and armors, I still haven't found the right things to make a chest piece for my rogue.  Many shops will sell you components (often really high end ones, too) for a price.  Alchemy works in very much the same way it does in other big MMO's or sandbox RPG's - find herbs in the wild and combine for potion effects.<br /><br />Ultimately, I highly recommend this title!",

You'll still have all your high level abilities, mastery points and gear, so you're still quite powerful compared to someone leveling through that content<br />*The mastery system was a nice way to make your post-leveling experience more fun and engaging<br />*Fast-travel system is very convenient<br />*While there is a \"meta\" for each class/spec, I have never felt forced to follow them.  There's plenty of variations when you select your talents and weapons.  Each class has a different skill-set with each weapon, which makes combat more interesting<br /><br />******************************************<br />*************  EDIT - 9/13/12  *****************<br />******************************************<br />I'm level 20 now, and I still think this is a great game!  Combat seems to be a little more than I'm used to when it comes to an MMO, which is definitely a welcome change.  Combat with mobs is actually closer to what PVP was like in WoW - you need to move around!  Learning how to use a new weapon still happens in a matter of minutes.  You equip it, and within a handful of mobs, you've unlocked all the possible abilities linked with it (hot-keyed 1-5.)  Each type of weapon has it's own style of combat.  With a warrior, I prefer a 2-handed sword and either a bow or gun in my secondary slot.<br /><br />Questing still feels the same, even though I've moved on to the new zone.  It's a bit of a grind at times, but frequently &quot;events&quot; will happen nearby.  These tend to involve killing an elite or escorting a NPC, and have a significant reward (XP, Karma and of course, money.)  I actually look forward to these, as they break up the grind a bit, and encourage teamwork.<br /><br />Teamwork brings me to my next thought!  There's no such thing as &quot;tagging a mob&quot; in GW2.  Everyone can take a whack, and if you participate in the kill, you're eligible for reward! (XP, drops, etc.)  This actually encourages players to work together, and not compete.  The same thing goes for resource nodes.  You see a copper or iron ore deposit, you get it.  No fighting or stealing!<br /><br />I've played WoW and FFXI fairly extensively, so the idea of MMO's isn't new to me (this is likely the case for most people here.)  Guild Wars 2 is my introduction to the franchise, however.  I have to say, so far, I like it!  I'll have to admit, WoW pretty much sets the standard about how I'd expect an MMO to play.  In some respects, this game surpasses it.  In others, it falls a little short (but in no &quot;game-breaking&quot; way, however.)  I also have a feeling that I'll update this review from time to time, as the very nature of this game will demand it.<br /><br />Crafting got a little easier once you get the hang of the &quot;discovery&quot; tab.  I chose to make weapons and armor, and I finally figured out that making the components for the weapons or armor pieces of choice, you can combine them with other crafted items and learn new patterns (thanks to YouTube!)  Each discovery gives you 1 of the item that you discovered, the ability to continue making them, AND a ton of XP toward your craft.  This seems like it cuts the resource grind from ridiculous to just very long.  Currently, I'm level a level 46 armorsmith, and have put a significant amount of effort into gathering resources. I need to eventually hit 75 so I can use the materials that I'm gathering in the 15-20+ zone.<br /><br />Leveling seems to happen a bit faster than I was used to in FFXI, or old school (pre-3.0) WoW.  Each time I've sat down, I've gained at least a level.  Heading back to old zones to farm for copper hasn't been a waste of time, either.  You'll level down to an appropriate level and still earn XP while gathering!  You can even participate in the events for more XP, karma and money, and yet you won't have a significant edge over folks that belong in the area (your gear is better, but you're otherwise gimped to their level.)<br /><br />Ultimately, the creators made a very solid MMO.  I haven't quite got hooked on it like I did with WoW, but that's a good thing, as I have other things to do.  I plan to continue playing, and updating as I go along.<br /><br />*************************************************<br />**************  ORIGINAL REVIEW  ****************<br />*************************************************<br /><br />Currently, I have a level 10 character, which I rolled up after abandoning a level 6 character that I didn't like.<br /><br />**LOGISTICS &amp; TECHNICAL THINGS**<br /><br />First off, this game has no monthly fee!  Which is great!  I've probably dropped a few hundred dollars in subscription fees for the other two MMO's that I used to pay.  Not having one is great!<br /><br />I bought the game from a store, and figured the installation would be faster since I wouldn't have to wait for a download at peak times.  I was rather wrong...  I still had about 3 hours between inserting the discs and finally playing; about 2 of those hours were from downloads!<br /><br />My gaming rig has an AMD FX-4100 CPU, 4GB of DDR3 RAM and an EVGA 550 Ti card, and I'm able to run with the graphics set to pretty high (almost peak) levels.  My GPU hardly notices, though the CPU is running all 4 cores at 50%+ load most of the time.  The RAM is stuck between 3.0 and 3.2GB at any given time.  Not once have I had a dip in frame rates or lag (I set the max frames at 60FPS, just because anything more is completely unnecessary.)  In short, this game seems fairly CPU-intensive, yet not very dependent on the GPU.  (Diablo 3, on the other hand, is the complete opposite.)  My system is by no means cutting edge, yet GW2 runs great on it.<br /><br />The graphics are decent, though I haven't notices much in the way of physics being used.  The weather effects look a bit dated (I think WoW's environments were nicer, actually.)  Sound-wise, I feel the game lacks.  The music is your standard-fare fantasy RPG symphonic music, and the voice acting is OK at best (in fact, I turned voice volume all the way down and just read the subtitles.)  I can't complain too much here, as lowering the graphical intensity will allow for more players.<br /><br />**STORY**<br />The Norn's starting zone is very reminiscent of what you'd expect in WotLK or Skyrim - a winter wonderland filled with things to kill!  The story so far is only OK...  Rather typical fantasy, but fine enough to drive the MMO. The intro has alluded to a menacing dragon and a power struggle.  Again, things seem fairly routine here.<br /><br />**GAMEPLAY**<br />When it comes to combat and exploration, the mechanics are fairly intuitive and things flow pretty freely here.  The map has plenty of icons, so once you figure them out,  you should be able to find anything you want.  Fast Travel is very straight forward and inexpensive.  here are several fast travel points through the starting zone, and once you discover them, you can jump to one from anywhere on the map for a nominal charge (5 or 6 coppers, so far.)  The Norn's hometown is connected in a similar fashion.  One thing I found rather strange were the &quot;Active Events.&quot;  From time to time, you'll get an onscreen notice saying &quot;An event is happening nearby.&quot;  Said event is usually a raiding party of baddies, or an NPC needing protection.  Anyone is free to join, and participation yields rewards on many levels.  Objectively, watching what's going on is a lot like watching little league ball games - it's just a giant cluster-@!#* of players chasing after mobs!  Regardless, they only take a few minutes, and the rewards are rather nice.<br /><br />Since this game was recently launched, the servers are getting hit.  Instead of making you wait to log on, they've implemented an Overflow Server.  You can jump right into the game, do all your quests, exploration and what-not, and all of that will transfer over to your main server once your queue pops.  From what I understand, only World Events won't transfer over, though I haven't had to deal with that quite yet...  Ultimately, I'm very appreciative of this Overflow Server idea!  It sure beats the 15min+ queue times that I had to deal with when FFXI and WoW were popular.<br /><br />Crafting so far hasn't been as clear.  As a warrior, I picked the very original professions of Armorsmith and Weaponsmith.  It seems like you need a tremendous amount of ore in order to make even the most basic item.  Then again, I'm used to crafting in WoW, where you can get started very quickly with a minimal amount of materials.  In the several hours of play time that I've already invested - a good chunk of that dedicated to gathering ore - I've only been able to make 4 inventory boxes, a sword and 2 pieces of armor.  I must've gathered a couple hundred pieces of copper ore.  I have yet to use the Discovery Tab, but I haven't found enough materials to do so.  Hopefully I can make more sense out of the system before long.  After all, I've just started.<br /><br />Questing is rather silly...  Outside of your &quot;personal story&quot; quests, you find a quest giver (empty beige hearts on the map) and do what they say.  You never have to return to them.  Once you complete the objective, you get a message in the mail, which will also include the award.  Speaking of mail, you no longer need to find a mailbox.  It's just a tab at the top of your screen!  Sure, this may lack &quot;realism,&quot; but let's face it.  All the realism we had in previous MMO's tended to bog down the game, and just required way more of our time.<br /><br />**Current Verdict**<br />As it stands, I'm quite happy with my purchase.  Guild Wars 2, for the most part, is a very well thought out MMO.  You can tell the people who designed this had the player in mind.  If you're here for great sound and graphics, you'll be disappointed.  The story is a little lack-luster, but the over-all gameplay makes up for it.  The crafting system seems a little complicated at the moment, but hopefully I'll sort those issues out on my own.  (I'm wondering of others feel the same way, however.)  They have greatly simplified questing, but again, I feel that they did this to reduce the amount of backtracking we need to do (player-focused design!)  This isn't a perfect game, but it's a very solid attempt.  Considering the fact that they don't require a monthly fee, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for an MMO!",

When I pre-ordered Book of Memories, I realized that it wouldn't be anything like the series.  I was actually grateful for the differences, as I am a fan of dungeon-crawlers in general.  For the most part, the graphics and music seem very \"Silent Hill'esque.\"  The more \"top-down-isometric view\" is a complete departure from what we're used to from the series, so you will not get the same feel as you would from the previous titles.<br /><br />**Combat**<br />Over all, I found the combat to be very fluid and easy to figure out.  I don't care much for the weapons breaking, but thus far, so many are available in each stage, you should be OK (though you might not be able to use your favorite one all the time.)<br /><br />**Story**<br />The story has only been OK so far.  A little convoluted, but I expected that.  The game play is why I'm here.<br /><br />**Game Play**<br />Classic dungeon-crawler!  Mash buttons when you see enemies.  Move out of the way when they swing at ya.  Some drop loot and of course you have limited inventory space (which is upgradable.)<br /><br />**Verdict**<br />Hardcore fans that want another entry in the Silent Hill series might be disappointed.  This is a game that uses themes and characters/monsters from the series, but feels almost nothing like any of it's predecessors.  The game is pretty good in it's own right.  I definitely recommend this to those who like hack-and-slash games (though this one has less loot) with puzzle-solving components.  Actually, this game seems a lot like Zelda without an overworld!",

The gameplay, however, is very monotonous. You get missions, you complete missions.  They all involve going to a relatively small area and killing all the monsters.  There is a psuedo-loot-grab carrot that's dangled, but most of the loot seems pretty useless (some is used to upgrade your gear, and what not.)  The story is minimal and bland. As I struggle to make it through on my first play, I don't see myself replaying it.  I don't hate the game, I just don't feel that it's that good.  Maybe it'd be worth $15 or $20.

                "text": "The PlayStation Vita is a great system, but it really needed a solid RPG.  Well, we finally have one!  I've played Persona 1 and 3, so the series isn't new to me.  Much like the previous entries, you're playing as a group of high school kids who're trying to combat an evil presence in your hometown.  As many people say, the game is an RPG with some sort of \"Sims\" elements.  I've never played The Sims, but I think I can see where they're coming from.  You need to balance your in-game life.  You can do whatever you'd like after school and at night.  Whether it be dungeon-crawling in the afternoon and sleep at night, or socializing then work.  But if you don't strike some sort of balance, then it's Game Over.  Now let's get into some impressions that I have about this game...<br /><br />Sound and Graphics:<br />The graphics are cell-shaded anime style, and are quite fluid.  The style fits the game perfectly.  The music, much like the rest of the titles in the series, is made up of catchy J-pop'ish tunes.  I really like what they've done here!<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The controls are pretty standard.  I haven't had any real issues with figuring anything out (no manual was needed.)  The social-life aspect, as well as the fusion of personae keeps things interesting.  There is no \"best\" way to play the game.  You'll likely find a way that suits your tastes, and it'll likely be different from other players.  Over all, I really like the mechanics of the game.<br /><br />Characters and Story:<br />I find that characters in many JRPG's can be very annoying and over-the-top.  Not so much the case here.  Each character was well-written, and the voice acting is well-done.  (They also have an option to turn off the voices during gameplay.  With this feature enabled, you only have to listen to them during the cut-scenes.)  The storyline is quite good, in my opinion.  They have this whole mysterious murder thing going on, and you are hellbent on figuring out what's going on; quite original, from my experiences.<br /><br />Ultimately, I couldn't recommend this game more if I wanted to.  The awesome story with good characters, great graphics and music, intuitive play controls and an interesting mix between RPG and life-simulation make for a winning combination. Any Vita owner who is looking for a solid RPG should check this game out!  Hell, I'm sad that I missed it on the PS2!  :(",

I made sure to buy directly from Amazon.com, and not from a third party.  Yes, this is the actual Sony brand, and ran me about $12 when I bought it.

                "title": "Great Expansion! (Long Review...)",
                "text": "My background:  I’ve been playing World of Warcraft since about a month before The Burning Crusade was released.  I saw most of the PVE and PVP content while it was current in The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Mists of Pandaria (I took a 2 year leave during the Cataclysm.)  In summary, I feel that Warlords of Draenor has been one of the best expansions that The World of Warcraft has received.  If that’s enough for you, then you can stop now.  This review might be a bit lengthy!<br /><br />I pre-ordered this expansion, but did not get time to level my main character to 100 until after the New Year, hence the delay in my review.  While leveling my paladin, I made sure to try to enjoy each zone as much as possible before moving on to the next.  I will break this review up into sections:<br /><br />#Questing - Over all, the questing in WoD has been very nice.  Blizzard has made it a point to make this as streamlined as possible.  The combination of the journal and the interactive maps really help you figure out where you need to go, and what you need to do.  The developers really made it a point to ensure that the rewards are class/spec specific, which is wonderful!  Each item you receive has the potential of receiving an item level upgrade too, which further enriches the experience.<br /><br />#Exploration - Those who really like to explore the zones and discover what the game has to offer are in for a treat.  Mists of Pandaria had this to some extent but Warlords of Draenor really nailed it.  There are “rare spawns” and miscellaneous treasures littered throughout the world here.  Sometimes they’re just off the beaten path and relatively easy to find.  Other times, you really need to work at it.  Like the quest rewards, each item has the chance of automatically being upgraded.<br /><br />#Garrisons - This is really  the biggest change that The World of Warcraft has seen yet.  The ability to build your own fortress, and “staff” it with followers has been a lot of fun (though it can be tedious if you try to maintain a garrison for each of your alts!)  There is a fair amount of flexibility here with what buildings you can choose, which adds to the appeal.  Each building has its own unique advantages/disadvantages, and will have a significant impact on the feel of the garrison (you can change things up too, so if you don’t like one, you can build over it!)  Your followers can be sent off on missions, which can offer some pretty nice rewards, either for them, or for your own character.  Your garrison will eventually have its own mine and herb garden, which significantly reduces the need for a gathering skill.<br /><br />#PvP - I’ve only dabbled a little bit with this.  Overall, it seems that Blizzard has made some significant improvements with the whole PvP/PvE gear conundrum.  The current PvP gear is at ilvl 620, but boosts to 675 when you’re in a PvP situation.  The stats are also geared more toward PvP instead of PvE still.  This seemed like a thoughtful way to help with the “raiding in PvP gear” problem.<br /><br />#Dungeons and Raids - The developers really seem to work hard to come up with ways to make the dungeons feel new and exciting.  Each expansion adds something new to the dungeon experience.  The Dungeon Finder is still far superior to the previous way of finding groups (either being in a good guild, or spamming trade chat.)  They also did a nice job with the loot system, as each player gets a personal chance at gear, instead of rolling on whatever drops.  I’ve seen each of the raids a few times now, and I do like the fact that they are significantly shorter than the raids in Mists of Pandaria.<br /><br />#General Improvements - It’s nice that multiple players can beat on the same rare spawn or unique mob, and still receive credit for the kill (Guild Wars 2 had this feature a while ago, and I thought it was great!)  I also like the expanded Void Storage and the Reagent Bank, as well as the tools used to search and sort your inventory.<br /><br />Now here are some annoyances I’ve found with this expansion.  None of them are really game-breaking, but I feel they should be addressed (and, according to the patch notes for 6.1, which should land soon, many will be!)<br /><br />#Crafting - This is where Blizzard seems to have dropped the ball.  Crafting was totally reformed.  Some of the changes make a lot of sense.  Others leave me scratching my head wondering “why?”  Regardless of what trade you’re picking up, you learn a bunch of skills all at once.  This is nice, as you don’t need to hover near the trainer when leveling your skill.  More powerful plans can be learned a bit more slowly, as you make the currency to purchase them, and you can make one per day.  Some trades are still fairly useful.  Others, like engineering, inscription, and especially alchemy feel a lot less useful now.  Even enchanting and jewelcrafting feel a little stripped-down.<br /><br />#Garrisons - It doesn’t make much sense that the herb garden comes so late in the game.  You need to be level 96 before you can open it up, yet the fishery (which is pretty close to useless for my play style) opens up at 94.  Then again, alchemy and inscription aren’t nearly as useful as they once were, either.  Some of the buildings also have quirks that aren’t obvious.  The rank 3 Stables perk doesn’t stack with Death Knights’ or Paladins’ movement speed buffs.  Trapping animals for the barn also can be a pain in the ass.  Primal Spirits are fairly hard to come by, and if you buy the wrong item, the vendor will only give you silver in return, and not the primals.  The animations for the completion of follower missions is fairly boring, especially if you’ve sat through several hundred of them.<br /><br />#Dialog/Voice Acting - The dialog and voice acting in this expansion, especially in the dungeons and raids, is really bad.  I wish you could turn it off.<br /><br />#Gathering Skills - The introduction of the mine and herb garden made herbalism and mining less useful.  Having them will help speed up your other trade skills, but the materials are not worth anything on the auction house (on my server, at least.)",

                "text": "I picked up Guild Wars 2 when it first came out, and at the time, thought it was only okay.  I returned to the game a few months ago, and I have to say it has improved substantially.  Many of the old mechanics have been modified/improved (added way points, loyalty bonuses, exploration bonuses) and there have been some great additions, like gliding.  I really like how Heart of Thorns got rid of the cut scenes for story progression, as it feels more natural, and thus gives a more immersive experience.  The addition of the mastery point system for max level characters is great.  Nearly everything important is linked to the account (magic find, masteries, outfits, boon-bearing items, etc.)  The lack of a subscription fee is very nice.  The gem shop offers some cosmetic/minor game-enhancing items for a dollar amount.  None of these are necessary to enjoy the game, but I can see why many folks would choose to spend some bucks on these items (mostly bag/character/bank slot increases, account-wide inventory slots, etc.)<br /><br />Some of the most attractive features for me are the map events, the fact that you never really &#34;outgrow&#34; a zone, and the sharing of resources and kills.  The map events keep things fresh, and provide decent rewards upon completion.  If you were to enter say a &#34;starting zone,&#34; you'd &#34;level-down&#34; to the appropriate level.  Of course, your abilities and improved help out and you will be more powerful than other low-bes, but you'll still earn experience and rewards.  Finally, the fact that everyone can mine the same nodes, chop the same trees, and gather the same herbs is wonderful.  There are no &#34;tagging of mobs,&#34; either.  If you land a hit, you get full experience and access to the drops.  These features give Guild Wars 2 a more pleasant play experience than some other popular MMO's (WoW, I'm looking at you!)<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm really enjoying the game.",

It feels solidly-built, has a decent battery life, and the displays are crisp and plenty bright.  I really like the fact that Nintendo opted to use standard micro SD cards for memory storage, instead of silly proprietary cards (a la Sony.)

                "text": "Dragon Warrior VII was quietly released back around the year 2000.  I only knew about it because I stumbled upon it at a Best Buy back when it was originally released.  While the game was rather graphically clunky, it was still a lot of fun.  I've been waiting for Sony to release it as a PS1 classic, or for an updated version to come out for quite some time now.  An update was released in Japan some 3 years ago, with rumor that it might come to the US on iOS, Android or 3DS.  Well, here it is, in all of it's glory on the 3DS!  And it's wonderful!<br /><br />The biggest improvement one would notice (had they played the original) is the graphics.  DQVII now looks pretty much like DQVIII from the PS2.  Other nice improvements include a journal-like feature, and polished dialogue.  The story is pretty much unchanged (though they claim the intro portion has been streamlined, but it still took me about 2 hours to get through.)  Mechanically, the combat is still the same as I recall, but they changed the graphical presentation, to match DQVIII.<br /><br />Some things that haven't changed - the music!  As usual to the series, the music is quite good, and always captures the mood of what's going on.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'd highly recommend this game to any RPG fan.  For those who've played the game before and enjoyed it, I think this will be a refreshing way to capture some nostalgia, as the visual improvements are definitely worthwhile.  Those who couldn't get into the original due to the rather terrible graphics, well... give this a whack!",

This game, for the most part, is true-to-form.  I've sank a few hours into the game since receiving it.  Overall, the look, sound and feel is very much on par with the original series (with some obvious improvements as the technology has advanced significantly.)  The play control is very responsive - maybe slightly too responsive.  I really have one  gripe - and that's the need for repeated use of the counter-attack.  Metroid games have always required fast response times, and the need to recognize patterns during boss fights.  Each enemy takes several shots to kill (even when using missiles or charged beam.)  Most will wind up and charge you.  You can either dodge, and pick them off, or master that counter.  If you pull off a successful counter, the enemy is stunned for a period, and can be dispatched readily. Unfortunately, I find myself  losing the advantage it gives (due to terrain or another incoming enemy.)  The counter could be a great mechanism, but it seems to be a bit overdone.  Ultimately, this is a balance issue.  I feel that Samus's weapons are underpowered, while the enemies attacks are overpowered, and you NEED to rely on the new counter in order to really make progress.<br /><br />All that being said, I got used to employing the counter attack, and the game is flowing.  It does a nice job scratching that nostalgia itch while feeling current (which makes 2 games in a row on the 3DS...  this and The Legend of Zelda:  A Link Between Worlds.)",

In fact, this series is what got me into RPGs, to begin with!<br /><br />For months now, I’ve been eagerly awaiting the release of Dragon Quest XI.  To date, I’ve played and enjoyed every release, except for DQX.  A review I saw said that this new installment felt old – it reused the same tropes that the previous games have played.  Well, there is a bit of truth to it.  Many of the familiar enemies show up, the combat, modes of exploration… Yes, this does feel very much like a Dragon Quest game, and that’s exactly what I was hoping for!<br /><br />The game is marvelously-rendered, and the scoring is beautiful.  I can’t say the story has been all that standard so far (not terribly surprising, but it has started off different than the previous installments.)  Some improvements have been made – save shrines, camp sites and the fact that you can actually see the enemies (yes, this has existed for a few of the previous games, but still worth noting!)  All the characters and NPCs I’ve met so far have added to the game, rather than detract from it.  While the main character is clearly someone in his mid-late teens, the game isn’t written to really make that a big deal, so I’m not getting the typical teen angst I normally pick up from JRPGs, and that’s a good thing.  I’m pushing 40 myself, so I can’t identify with those characters anymore.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this game to anyone who’s been a fan of the series, or to anyone who is looking to get started in the series, as it’s been quite solid so far.",

                "text": "I remember buying FF2/4 the day it came out and playing it for 12 straight hours.  The combination of the graphics and lush (for that time) scenery was almost too much to handle and the music is STILL stuck in my head to this day.  Much like FF3/6, this game is one of the classics that's in the Top 10 RPGs of ALL time.  Here is a breakdown of the game according to my rating system, with the original being the perfect standard:<br /><br />Graphics:  The GBA/DS doesn't disappoint with the sharper resolution and what seems to be slightly enhanced colors.  The portrait redraws are OK and the sprites all seemed to have at least been retouched with some more saturation.  The Mode 7 effects and all the magic effects are still the same.  There wasn't much improvement in this area and since GBA games are almost direct copies of SNES games, this isn't a big deal.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't add some richer textures and patterns in the games to make it sort of like the eye-popping visuals of FF3/6, but since it copies the original, that's OK. 8 out of 10<br /><br />Sound:  This is where the limitation of the GBA hardware comes into play.  The sounds are tinny, with none of that rumbly bass the SNES sound engine had (even with high quality headphones.)  The songs haven't been changed, but they're running through a different wavetable and it is obvious to those who remember the old SNES sounds.  It's still good, though.  This is one of the nicest soundtracks ever made to a game and it holds up well to anything today.  7 out of 10<br /><br />Translation:  I've played the full Japanese and original versions and I have to say that I am both pleasantly and unpleasantly surprised by the new dialogue.  While it DOES flow smoothly and articles are in place (i.e., THE Sand Ruby, instead of Sand Ruby), the translation takes minor liberties with the dialogue that can sort of spoil the original feel.  For example, fans of the original will be disappointed to learn that the magic spells are changed from FIRE 1, FIRE 2, FIRE 3 to the modern standard of Fire, Fira and Firaga.  It's not a huge deal, but I kind of miss the old names.  While \"spoony bard\" is still there, the package from the original is replaced with Bomb Ring.  Part of the mystery and sadness of Mysidia's destruction was that Cecil and Kain had no idea what was in the package and were just dupes.  Well...if you can't guess what a BOMB RING does, then you are as dull as a...well, Dark Knight's buttplate.  The text can be tiny at times...for old folks like me with bad eyesight, this can be troublesome.  Overall, the story hasn't changed and is as good as ever.  7 out of 10<br /><br />Gameplay:  This is where the game shines, as nothing has been subtracted from the original.  Rather, things have been added:  easier gameplay through the first half, additonal dungeons, and bestiary.  10 out of 10.<br /><br />If you liked the SNES version and need a portable one, then you need this game.  However, unlike FFI&II: Dawn of Souls, you're not getting a huge upgrade over the original and, in cases like the music, you're getting a little shortchanged.  If you don't need this to take on a trip, I'd recommend just playing the SNES version.  I know I still have mine!<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this:  32 out of 40.  Grade:  A",

                "title": "Ignore the Subject Matter...This Game Is Just Plain Fun!",
                "text": "OK, just ignore the fact that this game is Pokemon-based for a moment.  DS games are fun because the stylus allows for new types of gameplay and games that use this feature in novel ways are fast becoming a trademark for Nintendo, who can sell truckloads of DS units for each PSP that is sold.  Why?  Well, rather than try to make PS2 games work on a tiny unit that can't process the polygons or duplicate the controls, Nintendo wisely decided to make new, fun games for the DS and leave direct ports to GBA carts that DS owners could also pick up if they want some old-school action.  This concept of fun leads into the review of Pokemon Rangers.<br /><br />The premise is fairly easy, since Pokemon products are targeted at kids.  You're a male or female Pokemon Ranger neophyte, fresh in from the sticks and ready for training.  Your job is to basically assist people and Pokemon whenever they need it and defend Pokemon from greedy and neglectful individuals.  The intro is a bit long, but it's good to get the basics and story down.  You have a special Ranger tool called the \"Capture Styler\" that can, with your effort and goodwill, impart a calming emotion to wild or upset Pokemon and calm them down.  This is the entire capturing concept.  Once you've captured the Pokemon, its info is registered in the browser on the top screen and you can have the Pokemon follow you around.  Captured Pokemon can be used in several ways:  certain Pokemon have \"field moves\" that can break rocks, cut fences, grapple posts to pull you across water and so on.  Most Pokemon can also assist you in capturing by enhancing your styler with powers (e.g., grass assist makes your styler trail into grass, which stops Pokemon that touch it) and the electric Pokemon can recharge your styler.  This recharge capability becomes critical later on, as there is no real violence, but Pokemon can attack your styler line and damage it (0 styler energy=game over) and having a refill is always handy.  The kicker to this entire concept of using Pokemon is that, in the interest of not exploiting the Pokemon unfairly, you can only use their power once.  The only exception is your personal Pokemon, which you can charge up and use over and over.  Additionally, you may only have a limited number of captured Pokemon at one time and you have to let them free whenever you leave their native area.  This makes for some serious strategy, as you have to balance their usefulness in capturing with the necessity to clear obstacles with their field moves.  Also, do you carry a bunch of recharge Pokemon and only one field move one or do you balance out your herd with a battle-useful one, a recharge one and maybe a couple of field-useful ones?  This element is a welcome change of pace from the usual \"your gun can always fire unlimited bullets, just go get this one key and run across the map to unlock the door.\"  In this game, if you choose wisely, you can have a herd assembled and just blaze through obstacles.<br /><br />This game offers no real violence, as said before.  The \"battles\" are just capture sessions with no real time limit.  The Pokemon (one or more) appear in the bottom screen and immediately begin to amble, fly or ooze about.  Most of them have attacks that randomly go off and some can respond to seeing the styler capture loop...the trick is to time the capture correctly and avoid damage to the styler.  It gets progressively harder, forcing you to not just draw stupid circles all day, but wait and figure out patterns, try new strategies and take risks.  I'm sure it can get old after 4 or 5 hours straight, but in short doses, this is a welcome change of pace.<br /><br />The only real downside to the game is the sound.  The music is lame and the Pokemon make generic-sounding shrieks or cries instead of saying their name like they do in the cartoons.  The graphics are cartoonish, but fairly sharp and you can interact with a lot of objects.  The bottom screen holds all of the interaction and the top is taken up by the Stylus radar screen, so it's good use of the DS real estate.<br /><br />This game is good for kids because it teaches them resource management, hand-eye coordination and risk taking and does so in a very kid-friendly manner that doesn't involve blood, gore and foul language.  For adults, the premise and graphics might seem puerile, but the game IS fun in doses and is great for a breaktime distraction.<br /><br />This game is worth getting, in my opinion.  There's just too much fun and strategy to be had in such a small package.",

The game mechanics are sound and more like the online FFXI (no loading screens for every battle!) but the game, like most Final Fantasies, loses its lustre about halfway through.<br /><br />The numerous other reviews cover the pros and cons of the game in detail so I won't repeat them here.  What I WILL say, though, is that the designers seem to always want the gamers to lose interest in their game 50% of the way through.  For example, if you've enjoyed the game up to the 5 mandragora fight, the frustration and irritation will be enough to make you quit.  It's one thing if there's a strategy or some tactic to use and discover, but this fight is just a borefest of repetitively hitting one monster, watching your entire party get hit with 5 status effects simultaneously and having them lose 80% of their HP. You barely survive, inflict a scratch or two on one of the 5 monsters...and repeat, repeat, repeat.  After 3 hours of this, I had enough.  Checking game guides and FAQs reveals that this battle is exactly how I described it.  Even though each monster has a weakness, you won't want to win the fight.  Also, getting money is so difficult, that boss battles will WRECK your item stores and you have to sit and gather money for hours just to move forward.  It gets to the point where I can't stand it anymore and I just use a Gameshark to get 9999999999 gil!<br /><br />There is also a lot of random wandering and wasted time backtracking if you don't have some sort of game guide map.  If you're like me and you have a day job and can only play games for a few hours a week, you want to get the most out of your games and see more of their stories...not slog around the same area for 5 months just to get to level ____ so you can barely beat the area boss!  I know that the game has to be made to satisfy a large cross section of gaming styles, but it would be nice to have all the straightforward bosses and areas be critical to the game and put the super-annoying bosses and areas to the side so that casual gamers can play through and see more of the entrancing storyline and visuals and the hardcore gamers can wear themselves ragged on beating some stupid turnip people.  This game will make boss fights so hard that you cannot pass them at a reasonable level...or you have to have the foresight to buy some gambit or license or spell or weapon to win...if you didn't, then you have to start over from the last save point and slog back to town and then slog back to the boss.<br /><br />I wish, I wish, I wish this game could be more story-oriented than \"let's make the player hang out for 15 hours of power-leveling and gil-gathering goodness so he can tear his eyeballs out when he gets beaten by the bosses and finds out he needs SIXTEEN hours of leveling!\"<br /><br />Slogging through endless battles and having to go backtrack in resource gathering as well as terrain-wise gets this game a 2 in fun.  The visuals, sound, voice acting, plot and the world it creates merits a 4.  This game is flashy...but not so much fun.<br /><br />NOTE:  I have played and beat every Final Fantasy from 1-10 (plus X-2) and the mechanics of having to sit and level in some way are similar in all of them...I'm just too busy to enjoy sitting around to do it anymore.",

                "text": "What made the Metal Gear series so wonderful was the concept of a lone operative sneaking into a base a la James Bond, but doing it realistically (crawling, hiding, sniping) instead of getting invited to a white-tie dinner by the bad guy.  In the first PS1 game, you could be a novice player and still make it through the game, each time you play making you better and better.  The PS2 games got more and more complex, sort of bloating up the concept with more complex controls and quick reaction scenarios where the average player would get creamed over and over again until the learning curve was passed.  These \"frustration points,\" as I call them got more and more numerous until MGS3, where the entire last third of the game was essentially one long frustration point (e.g., oops, stepped wrong, you die, oops, didn't make the shot, you die, oops, didn't lead the girl through 5 screens of bad guys safely, start over, etc.)  To a hardcore gamer, these challenges are meat and potatoes, but to a casual gamer that can't play daily, the fourteenth time that 3 Metal Gears blow Snake into atoms is the time that the game gets shelved permanently.  This is where MGS:Portable Ops puts itself:  it's JUST hard enough to make the hardcore MGS fans want more, but JUST hard enough to frustrate the casual gamer into just shelving it.<br /><br />First off, the game looks great and the sounds are perfect.  How they crammed all of this into a UMD is spectacular and shows how well software developers can compensate for poorly-designed hardware.  The controls aren't too bad, but the analog nub can be hard to control at times.  The real permanent frustration point in the game comes with the camera, which seems to have a mind of its own.  Dragging enemies (a HUGE part of the game) becomes a comedy of errors as the whirling camera causes you to spin around while you get used to the analog nub...you look like you're tangoing with a drunken partner!  The camera likes to sit right up against your active man, so you can't pan out and get a wider view of things...this is especially fatal when going through doors, where you can see an all clear and pop out right into a guard's line of fire.  For me, the camera is enough to make the game unpleasant...but I suppose it can be gotten used to.  The missions are broken up into little ones (UMD format again) and they seem fine.  They make sense and you do have some sense of time in the game.  Well done!<br /><br />MGS games are all about sneaking and infiltrating.  Well, this MGS takes it one step further by allowing you to recruit soldiers for different teams (this has been explained in other reviews.)  This is sort of a tactics-style development where you can outfit the troops, put them in squads and deploy them as a team.  However, the developers decided to hamstring this potentially fun feature by making it so killed soldiers never return...so you can get a secret character for a major accomplishment...and he gets an unlucky camera angle on the next mission and ends up getting jumped by 3 guards.  Well, your hard-earned man is now gone forever unless you reload.  By making the risk too great, this keeps casual gamers from risking hard-earned troops on the battlefield.  They should have an option for an easier mode where the soldiers can be brought back.  However, the saving grace is that the unique characters (such as Snake) can be brought back and recover slowly.<br /><br />This game is very complex and mastering it, or even proceeding in it takes a large time investment...unfortunately, it's not one that most casual or older gamers might be able to make.  The manual only tells you how things work on a basic level and, like ALL NEW GAMES TODAY, you can't just have fun and play through...you've got to have the FAQ/game guide/cheat sheet with you or you'll never get 100% complete and the best ending.  Lame.<br /><br />With very little to reward the casual gamer, I can't recommend this as a 5-star pick. I'd rate it a 1. However, since it's so appealing by its tough nature to hardcore gamers (5 stars for them!), it DOES merit a 3 on the fun factor (1+5/2).  The polish of the game is super and only the whirly camera demon knocks it down to 4 stars.",

Killer graphics (even by today's standards), great sound (if you like the techno beats from the PS version), great, responsive gameplay and strategy all wrapped up in a tiny silver disc!  It even has online features and playing with friends is a blast!  That most PSP games are pathetic ports of PS1 games and crappy movie adaptations is disappointing in the face of games like this.  It's almost like Sony said, \"OK guys, HERE'S how you make a PSP game,\" and then the developers promptly ignored them!!!<br /><br />First off, the graphics are gorgeous.  Futuristic and smooth.  The music is appropriate and very techno.  The controls are crisp and mastering the airbrake system on each racer is the key to victory...since hamfisted handling WILL result in eating wall and losing races.  There is a certain strategy to hitting boost points and picking up weapons for use against others or for a quick energy boost.  You can't just mash the button and ride a rail all the way to the finish line; you have to be involved and jink/dodge/boost/draft/ram your way in!<br /><br />I got this game used for $9.99 and it's more fun than the new crop of PSP games coming out.  I highly recommend it; even if you get frustrated racing against others, you can do time trials or free racing as a quick diversion and play against yourself.<br /><br />Can't go wrong here.

                "text": "If you're a PSP owner, then you're no doubt aware that a lot of PSP games are either rush jobs for a quick buck or poorly-done ports of old PS1 games.  Developers also want to take a system not designed for handling a lot of polygons and lots of analog action and try to make action games for them...so you'll be pleased to discover that Metal Gear Acid 2 is a game that is made for the limitations of the PSP and works WITH the system to give a sound, fun and solid(us?) gaming experience.<br /><br />First off, the game eschews long, drawn-out dialogue scenes for long, drawn-out text passages.  It seems like bloviating and long-winded proselytizing are trademarks of the MGS line, so adding a fast text skip button gets you into the action quickly.  However, there IS some small snippet here or there of dialogue and it breaks things up a bit.  I'm glad they chose not to go with full motion polygon movies and speech because they used that saved space very wisely.  The game looks..well, gorgeous, with the characters sharp, cel-shaded, loudly-colored and detail all over the place.  The art is classic Konami excellence with none of that messy, brush splatter confusion of Ashley Wood anywhere to be seen.  You get crisp, cool, cartoony Snake and Friends and it looks marvelous.  Anime speed lines, camera cuts and a very decent in-game camera control make this game a treat to play.  Also included is a cardboard version of those Magic Eye puzzles where you get a split screen image and the included cardboard box overlay makes it pseudo-3D (you can also use your eyes, if you're good at those Magic Eye things.)  This is just a little extra and you don't lose anything by leaving it out.  The designers also included a ton of secret cards and the capability to access MGS3 for the PS2 via USB to USB mini cable for photo transfer!  The sounds are generic, as is the music, but it fits and doesn't stomp all over the game.<br /><br />The game itself doesn't rely on quick reflexes so much as it does planning, some strategy and luck (on card draws).  The game and manual are no real help for newbies and unless you can find someone else to explain it better, you'll be sort of lost through the first few missions as you learn the game's fine points.  I particularly enjoy the turn-based aspect of this game.  As I've grown older, I've lost a lot of the ability to play fast reflex games and the PSP, with its small screen, isn't ideally suited for games where a camera angle is the difference between life and death.  That's just frustrating (see: MGS:Portable Ops for this problem).  This game allows for planning moves and seeing the battlefield; this is something I appreciate.  This game seems more fun and relaxing than worrying that the wall you can't see around has 14 guards to ruin your gametime.<br /><br />This game is interesting, unique and oddball enough with plenty of flair to attract those not really into fast action games.  However, it's also a good diversion from the usual PSP fare.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!",

Portal is addictive puzzle gaming and even the Episodes provide more action and good story. TF2....well, let's just say that it's more fun than should be legal.  You can read any review of any part of this Orange Box and believe what they say about how GOOD the games are.<br /><br />However, you cannot possibly know how awful Steam is unless you click every attachment in spam emails that you get.  Steam is a virus that runs your games for you and inserts itself between you and a good time.  Constant validation bugs ensure that you'll be sitting there watching Steam validate for hours on end without changing instead of playing TF2, or Steam crashing on you just before you beat that puzzle in Portal you've been working on for hours.  Or it just spams you with ads for other games when you open it up.  Support?  DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!  When Steam hangs on you, the ONLY solution you'll ever get is to spend 6 hour reinstalling/redownloading Steam and all your games and reupdating them.  Then, after Steam hangs again, you uninstall it and go buy games that let YOU own them...not lease them from this infernal agent of irritation.<br /><br />Steam is the WORST thing to ever happen to gaming and I join the other reviewers in wishing its creator to be shot into the sun from a giant cannon using...STEAM power.<br /><br />Blarrrrgh, Steam sucks as much as HL2 and TF2 rule.

                "text": "Let me just say that I've been playing FPS (first person shooter) games since the old days of Castle Wolfenstein and I've always used regular mice to play.  When I was younger, it wasn't a problem to spend hours on a game with no aches and pains, but now I can't use a normal mouse for much longer than an hour without a twinge somewhere or another in my hand.  When I was looking into getting a new mouse to replace the little optical one I had been using (quite painfully, might I add), I came across this in a computer store.  I tried the demo model and ordered one immediately.  I was hooked!<br /><br />This mouse is BIG and HEAVY when compared to most mice and, when put up against the Logitech gaming lineup, it seems to be at a disadvantage.  The mouse seems less graceful and the buttons aren't as hair-trigger responsive as the Logitech lineup...however, once I started seriously using this mouse in everyday situations (net surfing, Photoshop, etc.) it really showed its excellent design.  It fits comfortably in the hand and doesn't require that the fingers be constantly poised above the buttons.  You can rest your fingers across the buttons and push easily when you want to click.  This is CRITICAL in games for me, since holding my fingers over the buttons (as I had been doing before) was what seriously wore my finger tendons out so quickly.  Being able to rest my fingers, yet respond quickly to input helped keep my game scores up while not wearing out my hand.  The weights seemed gimmicky at first, but I quickly learned that extra weights really helped me keep the mouse stable and it reduced my twitching in FPS games.<br /><br />The LCD IS a gimmick, no doubt, but the ability to switch 3 DPI settings on the fly is nice.  In FPS games, general gameplay is good around 2000 DPI, but precision shooting (like for a sniper class in an FPS) requires MUCH less mouse movement over a broad area and more controlled movement in a smaller area.  1600DPI is perfect for this.  I can instantly switch, as needed, with no delays.  The side buttons are also perfect for alt fire and are easily pressed with the thumb.  I haven't used the macros, so I can't comment on that feature, but even the heavy scroll wheel just feels much nicer on the fingers.<br /><br />The feet might make a difference if you're not using a nice mousepad.<br /><br />The best feature by far is the weighted box that stores the spare feet and weights.  It holds down the cable very well.  Kudos to Microsoft for getting that right!<br /><br />In conclusion, I would say that if you still have the ability to poise your index and middle finger over sensitive mouse buttons for hours on end, you might find better results with another mouse.  However, if you've got scars on your tendons from too much mouse use, trying this mouse out will be wonderful.  The weight, button presses and ergonomics are great.  The bonuses of the DPI switch, adjustable weights/feet and the cable weight box just turn this mouse into an excellent value.<br /><br />5 stars.  A worthy recipient of the Sidewinder name.",

                "text": "The entire Armored Core series of games have always centered around large robots, infinitely customizable, and pilotable in multitudes of environments on various genres of missions.  AC:For Answer definitely fits this pedigree and looks amazing.  However, there are some serious flaws in this game that ruin the fun and remove this from the Must Play list of the casual gamer.<br /><br />1.  Camera:  The camera angle is just a LITTLE too close to the player unit to be useful.  You get a very narrow range of forward vision, so you'll constantly be straining to see what's directly ahead of your unit.  The WORST part is that the right analog stick, used to look around, becomes extremely hard to use during duels with other ACs.  Since those ACs strafe in a circle around your AC constantly and since they often have nicer boosters than you do, you spend 90% of your duel time trying to simply FIND the enemy with the camera spinning around.  You spend the other 10% of your time locating the enemy and then waiting for missile lock.  You'll spend quite a bit of time getting nailed by energy blasts and gunshots from behind, the side and everywhere you can't see.<br /><br />2.  Difficulty:  Some missions are so easy, they're laughable.  Others are so difficult, you'll die within seconds and not know why.  The best one is where you get a VOB (booster) unit strapped to your back and rocket towards a large target while supporting units fire at you.  Since you can't maneuver well, you take 5 hits and the mission's over.  Lather, rinse, repeat.<br /><br />3.  Infinitely customizable, but...:  There are thousands of combinations to choose from and each part can be further tuned with units of FRS memory, which is awarded for completing missions.  However, out of the many combinations of equipment, only a few certain assemblies have any chance of surviving missions.  Since there is no advance way to know just how long a mission will be or how many enemies you'll face, it's nearly impossible to plan a weapons loadout that would suit the mission until you play through it.  To prevent this, specialty loadouts (i.e., all beam energy or all missle) are best shelved until the replay.  I found the most success with a balanced loadout.<br /><br />4.  SLOWDOWN:  On a lot of the missions when things get crazy, I saw my framerates drop to nothing.  Arms Forts are HUGE and MASSIVE fortresses that spray missles all over the place (99% of them will unerringly home in on you) and when you rush up on one to destroy it, expect your framerates to drop to an almost unplayable level.  I am not sure if installing the game to the PS3's hard drive ameliorates this, but it's horrible to see the PC gaming experience come to the PS3...<br /><br />In all, this game is good for the hardcore fans and for anyone who enjoys spinning the camera around like crazy.  For the casual gamer, though, this game is not enough fun and too much annoyance to be worth a purchase.",

                "text": "When I first played Resident Evil for the PSX, I thought it was just a limitation of the controls or PSX hardware that made the characters utterly unable to move while using a weapon...but it's something that's persisted through EVERY SINGLE GAME IN THE SERIES!  With this being 2011 and the PS3 having more than enough horsepower to do it, I cannot understand why Capcom won't let you walk and shoot in this game!!!  The graphics, sound, secrets and anything else becomes distant to the problem controls that you'll fight more than the onscreen zombies!  Let's go through the specifics:<br /><br />1.  Graphics:  Appropriately next gen in color and very gritty and realistic.  Backgrounds are busy, but not so much that you'll lose your way (there is a good map system to help).  The only crappy parts are the low res models of things you interact with (like in the first level where the melons look like billiard balls or the guts and goats look like PS2-era models).  This game only runs in 720P, so you're not getting the 100% 1080P experience.  The character models are very detailed and you get costumes for them, too, which is nice, but the faces suffer from that blockiness that plagues all games done before LA Noire...<br /><br />2.  Sound:  The voices are a little less corny than usual and the music is OK.  It's more for mood than anything, so you won't remember any of the tunes.  The gun sounds are good and the zombie moans are also good.<br /><br />3.  Gameplay:  100% AWFUL.  HORRIBLE.  MISERABLE.  What the other reviews fail to mention (except for the one star ones!!!) is that the controls are really complex and painful to get used to.  You cannot shoot or melee and move at the same time, so you must plant in one place, move the nub to aim (no aim assistance!) and fire.  If you melee, you must plant at the perfect distance from an enemy and swing your knife...if you're too far away, you'll miss and get jumped, whacked, stabbed, or axed.  The camera is sort of fixed in a \"cameraman\" view, which means that it's 3rd person, slightly offset so that your character is on the left part of the screen.  He/she also fills a good third of the screen, too, meaning that your field of vision is VERY limited.  You can't see much on your left and you'll see only from your character's waist up, meaning that it is that much harder to estimate melee distance unless you are always looking downwards.  In groups, you'll be jumped from all directions and never know it.  Although I am sure none of this is a problem with the Move, it's really aggravating with the regular controller.  Your partner gets in the way most of the time and only comes in handy when you're blindsided (which will happen very often) and kicks a zombie off of you or revives you.  The controls alone make this game annoying to the point of breaking it, but add the limited field of vision and you're looking at a miserable experience.<br /><br />4.  Story:  Standard RE stuff:  zombies somewhere, Chris goes there, meets a woman, teams up.  I frankly never even cared about the story, I was so dreading the actual gameplay.<br /><br />I spent 10 minutes on this game and returned it.  You'd think that moving and shooting would be standard in ANY action game, but Capcom distinguishes RE by eschewing that in favor of planting in one place.  If you're a fan of awkward controls that get in the way of the gameplay (see Uncharted 2 for an awesome control system!) and make you not even CARE about the story, then get this game.  If you need smooth controls, avoid this at ALL COSTS.",

This story rips off Shadowrun/cyberpunk and does a poor job.  The story serves only to give the player something to think about while the load screen whisks the character off to the next linear stage.  1 out of 5<br /><br />Graphics:  The backgrounds look good (sharp and crisp) and the textures are VERY hi res and nice...however, in 2011, I expect a game to be in 1080p, not 720p.  I also expect non-blocky character models that don't have bratwurst fingers and clipping on the mouths when characters speak.  This game's graphics would have been excellent in 2007...in 2011, they are just mediocre.  2 out of 5<br /><br />Sound:  The sounds are good, but the voice acting is terrible...it's wooden, stilted and the characters SOUND like they're reading a script.  If there is music, it's not memorable enough to remember or care about.  The blips and bloops that the augments and environment make are right on, though.  2 out of 5<br /><br />Controls:  Pretty good.  The walking animation is jerky and the hold+cover system is a little wonky, but the controls are pretty good.  Aim assist helps when trying to aim with analog nubs.  4 out of 5<br /><br />Gameplay:  This is where Deus Ex: Human Revolution goes from \"GAME OF THE YEAR BECAUSE WE GOT PAID TO SAY SO\" (IGN) to the worst game that's come out this year.  Almost nothing in the game world can be manipulated...in the original, all objects could be manipulated or messed with, somehow.  In Deus Ex, the gorgeous environment is static: glass doesn't break unless it's a giant pane of it, microscopes can absorb bullets without moving, the only things to move are vending machines, boxes, crates and so on.  Your super augmented avatar must eat and drink to restore energy to do melee attacks and use augmentations...yet, he cannot bust open a 12-pack of soda or open a glass door fridge.  You can only get single cans left around.  Lockers and drawers in offices contain boxes of bullets or grenades.  You can't hop over obstacles while covered.  Upgrades are hard to obtain.<br /><br />(New paragraph!) Another huge problem is that this game offers NOTHING new in the genre.  Modern games are ALWAYS:  tough guy goes in against bad guys and is gruff and serious (or gruff and funny) and gets a lot of weapons, starting with a pistol and there's a rocket launcher somewhere.  You need keys and you can upgrade abilities.  THERE IS A COVER SYSTEM...hoo boy!  Enemy AI is sad.  You can headshot them and pitch a grenade in when their friends come to investigate.  There is no point to being stealthy because your health regenerates...I didn't see anything in this game that other games haven't already done better.  0 out of 5<br /><br />The best part of this game is that the box art is good and there are a LOT of people from Quebec that worked on it.  The worst part is the game itself and that I cannot return it for a refund after opening it...<br /><br />AVOID THIS GAME (or at least rent it, first).  It's ALL hype and you know that the developers had to do some serious payday to the big magazines to get everyone convinced that clunky voice acting, mediocre graphics and boring gameplay are what people really want in 2011.<br /><br />I am old enough to remember when innovation was the key driver for gaming, not graphics and a cover system....",

Normal bots are pretty dopey, but several different bots have super specializations and you will curse the shinobi and sniper bots towards the end of the game. This game is NOT an unrealistic tactical game; if you charge in with guns blazing, you WILL DIE.  You need to use cover and keep your squad focused.  You need to manage ammo early on and the need for upgrades versus immediate supplies versus nanomachine augments for your squad.  There's a LOT to this little game and you wouldn't know it from reading some of the cursory reviews from the &#34;big name&#34; sites that obviously didn't get into the game's depth.<br /><br />The game IS a shooter on rails, but it's well done.  I lived in Japan for years and the old Tokyo looks like shitamachi areas and the Upper City really has that Japanese technofuturistic feel. There is plenty of Japanese dialogue (which is well done, even if the translations are off a bit) and I really like how the signs and real brand names are incorporated into the backgrounds to really give life to the city.<br /><br />The controls are OK and take a little getting used to.  You will get knocked about, knocked down and staggered when taking damage and that can work against you when you take a shot from a boss, fall down and then he stomps you flat.  You'll also have to complete some of the quicktime events more than once....as they are easy to screw up.  Your squadmates can be a little obtuse, too, jumping in front of your fire and then griping about it.<br /><br />The trust system is pretty cool but it doesn't affect your squad very much.  What it DOES do, however, is affect the ending you see and you will want to keep high trust through the entire game.  Just answer logically when they ask a question, don't shoot them and go for melee kills and headshots to bump that trust up.<br /><br />The boss fights can be a little cheap.  Each major boss has several attacks that will stagger you mid run and the final boss will aggravate you for a half hour with weapons that take you out in one hit.  Thankfully, your squadmates can revive you and you can use first aid kits to both revive yourself AND your squadmates...which you want to do before they die!  They will also help each other.  The shops sell spare first aid kits, nanomachine upgrades, ammo, grenades, bosonic charge for your rifle and a limited selection of weapons.<br /><br />It's not a long game.  I'd estimate 10 to 15 hours total to get through it.  But it's a good game with a pretty cool story.  If you can pick it up for less than $20, definitely do so.<br /><br />**Note:  I had a mic but never really used the voice commands with that.  You can hit a button and do the same thing.",

The game graphics are OK, but there is a lot of character model clipping and it can be difficult to shoot around obstacles.  Here are some highlights of why I give a 2 star rating, rather than rehash what has already been said:<br /><br />1.  The game starts pretty well.  Heavy story and good usage of cutscenes to draw you in.  The aiming system isn't such a stickler for accuracy so shooting isn't bad.<br />2.  LOTS of guns!  Each one is useful in some way.  You'll never run short on ammo unless you are camping.<br />3.  Lots of different things to do.  From a guided drone tank to heli flying, you get to do lots of good stuff.<br />4.  Lots of save points<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />1.  Models are kind of clunky, even if they are detailed.  Korean soldiers mostly wear yellow and red so you can see them; there's no tactical value in dressing like a paramilitary Ronald McDonald.<br />2.  Over-the-top movie morals where the bad guys are so HORRIBLY bad that you have full license to kill them in any way you can....unless it's part of the plot to feel sorry to kill them.<br />3.  There Is NO free will in this game.  It's a shooter on rails.  You fail at a mission, you just keep trying over and over until you figure it out.  Prompts are not always helpful....<br />4.  The enemy AI consists of two modes:  super sniper mode (where you are behind cover but still get shot by enemies across the map) and move mode (where they either camp behind one obstacle until they die or run at you in the open without taking cover).  This game also LOVES to have your teammates shout (IT'S CLEAR!) then you get killed by a single bad guy who suddenly pops up behind you!<br />5.  Enemies respawn infinitely until you progress to a certain point.  I didn't realize this until halfway through the game when I was running out of ammo and having to run forward to grab guns on the ground....then the enemies would stop coming.<br />6.  You have magic regenerating health<br /><br />I didn't play the multiplayer version (I got this used and wasn't about to pay for an online pass) so I can't comment on that.  I CAN say that this is, like most THQ games, mediocre, at best.  If you can get it for 5 or 6 bucks like I did, then it's worth a try.",

If you're looking for a deep story, good mechanics and a well-crafted game world, you need to move along to another game.<br /><br />I could never get into the Atelier series.  They seemed custom crafted to appeal to gamers who love chirpy, super cute graphics.  Atelier Shallie promised to be the best of the series so I checked it out and was very disappointed.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />The graphics are pretty good.  The environments can be a little sparse but the character design is bright and colorful with quite a lot of details.  You can tell that Gust was working on attracting the neckbearded anime nerds and female Goth/Loli lovers with the designs.  The menus are bright and the color palette seems to strike the right blend of gloom (the world maps) and cute (the menu screens).<br /><br />Sound:<br />The music is bland and entirely forgettable.  The character voices are stereotypically Japanese (if you play with Japanese dialogue turned on).  Girls' voices are at the upper end of dog hearing and the guys are about 1 notch below.  Enemies don't make much noise, at all.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The main thrust of the game is doing missions and synthesizing items with alchemy.  This is about 80% of the game and if you are into this kind of thing then you will love this game.  The areas (just one or two screens each) can be selected and you can run through them and battle enemies and harvest items.  The items and monsters respawn each time you go through.  The big problem is that battles are either really easy or impossible.  You'll blow through normal enemies and then you'll meet a HUGE monster that you cannot even dent.  Death means nothing and you just go back to the World Map.  The battle mechanics are OK and you can keep a reserve member to help defend or attack.  The problem is that the battle animations are rough: enemies fade away, attack animations are choppy and the battles seem like just a waste of time.  You get seemingly arbitrary amounts of experience points and there's no real way to judge if a battle will be easy other than to just try and see if you can win.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Milquetoast Shallie or Incompetent Shallie has to do a bunch of quests because blahblahblahblah.  The plot is almost nonexistent and creates no urgency or wonder or anything but &#34;now do this quest and then after that do this one.&#34;  It's like running down a checklist. None of the characters have anything but basic, stereotypical personalities.<br /><br />This game has potential but falls short on an enjoyable experience.  It's almost as if a design team said &#34;what if we stopped taking time to write a plot and just made the sidequests into the main quests?&#34;",

The story is OK, the options are diverse in combat and dialogue, the animation and movies are top-notch and even the voice acting is good.  The game world is also very well done.  I just couldn't get into the wonky combat system and the horrible controls.<br /><br />Geralt moves on a hair trigger, so it is very hard to control in a pinpoint manner.  You'll sprint-stop endlessly to try to get to one NPC to talk to.  You'll dance and shimmy around enemies you are trying to target.  You'll overshoot your marks dozens of times an hour.  The fact that enemies tend to gang up on you and you don't have a way of precisely and rapidly retargeting (you'll keep choosing the enemies you don't want) makes combat frustrating, especially since ranged attacks are not so powerful.  I made it about 4 hours into the game before I couldn't take it anymore.  This one's going back and I'll look somewhere else.<br /><br />I really think that gaming has gotten into a rut where EVERY GAME has to be third person with the same controls, the same wobbly camera, the same minimap/quests and cliched story with grim/muscular heroes and tons of lore that doesn't mean anything.  I really couldn't tell if this was Dragon Age VI: the Swordening or not.  It would be nice to get more games with real plots like Planescape:Torment....",

                "text": "This game has a lot of promise but just seems to come off as a half-finished game where they did EVERYTHING to one half completion and then packaged it up as a full game.  I bought it new and and stopped playing about halfway through the second playthrough.  I should not have listened to all the paid hype around this game when it was first released and I have learned my lesson.<br /><br />The Graphics:  They are bleak but serviceable.  There is at least consistency within the game's backdrops and the user interfaces are also very clean.  Sparkles and little visual signals make sure you don't miss dropped items and the details in the settings, when they are there, are very well done.  The only reason everyone says this is graphically great is that you can see up the skirt of 2B.  Otherwise, the graphics are OK and reflect the current level of PS4 development capability.<br /><br />The Gameplay:  The combat system is only half finished.  A game like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry is much better from a standpoint of fluid combat and combat options.  You basically have a light or heavy weapon attack (as 2B) or a light weapon/hacking attack (9S).  However, while you flip and twirl and kick swords out at people, you can't interrupt your combos once you get them going.  I ended up using the third mode of attack, a drone weapon (bullet stream, laser, missiles, etc.)  that strikes from a distance about 90% of the time.  It doesn't do as much damage but all you have to do is strafe around a target, lock the drone on it and hold the button down until it explodes.  This works on bosses, too, and is the only way to beat them without taking any damage at all.  Melee attacks are more powerful but since you can't interrupt a combo easily, you'll take a hit more often than not.<br /><br />The enemy AI:  A JOKE.  The bad guys all look like Android OS mascots and come in several varieties....but most differences are just cosmetic.  There are probably only a handful of enemy types in the game and you will run into them over and over again.  Bosses are easy:  just strafe-dodge and hammer away with the drone gatling gun or missles, occasionally using the charged drone laser.<br /><br />The sound:  The soundtrack is VERY good but I only ever heard a few songs playing.  Sound effects are adequate.<br /><br />The story:  Told from 3 viewpoints, you will have to play through the game 3 times to find out everything.  Just like Bravely Default was able to copy and paste the first half of the game into a second half and score a full title with only 50% of the effort, this game copies and pastes TWO times to give a &#34;complete&#34; game with only 33% of the effort!  It was OK the first time and got so boring the second time that I just quit playing.  If I want to sit through the rest, I'll watch a longplay on YouTube.  The story boils down to &#34;we thought robots were bad BUT WE WERE WRONG.  OR WERE WE?&#34;  and you have to get all the right endings to get the final ending.  There are also joke endings (try selling your OS chip) that basically force you to reload the game and those are just irritating.  The game is trying to be clever but ends up falling flat.  There is no real story to speak of in this game....this bland, vanilla game.  The game itself has a bunch of fetchit quests that are neither fun nor entertaining.<br /><br />The chip modification system is OK, but the seemingly endless variety of configurations are not always useful and only a few setups will allow you to progress through the game.  For my playthroughs, I equipped a healing chip or two and then never worried about dying again.<br /><br />The main characters:  2 stereotypes wander around killing hordes of bland, similar enemies.  Neither one has a dynamic personality.  One is goth loli bait with white panties and the other is a twink 12 year old with schoolboy shorts.<br /><br />Overall, this game was frustrating because, like many recent Japanese games, it focuses all the effort on finishing 50% of everything (combat, characters, story) and then just throws in cheap filler at ship time.  I did enjoy the first playthrough somewhat (3.5 stars on that) but I can't recommend this game to anyone who wants a deep, engaging action RPG.",

The area you get to explore is very accurate and looks quite a lot like Kabukicho in Tokyo while the voice acting is really well done.  Although it's kind of corny and melodramatic, the story is also kind of fun but the translation is loose in places and some liberties are taken with what the characters say.  The graphics are kind of blocky but serviceable and you will see just how much collectible stuff is there to find when you first start up the game.  In addition, you get a few free items to start with that can really help you on the mean streets.<br /><br />What I DO NOT LIKE are the following points:  CONTROLS and BATTLE SYSTEM.  This is a button mashing third person fighting game and the controls are soft, unresponsive and mushy.  Your character moves sluggishly and reacts to your button presses a half second after input.  Keeping the enemy in the camera view alone is a pretty big challenge.  Although you get several fighting styles and some super moves to use, the fighting system is mostly based on you attacking and the AI just standing there for the most part.  In low-level/trash mob battles, you will wipe the floor with them and not really do anything but mash attack over and over.  However, when you face a boss, you are in for a good 10 minute fight with repetitive quicktime action events and AI that blocks 99.98% of your attacks.  This turns boss battles into an unrewarding grind that becomes annoying very quickly.  It wouldn't be so bad if the controls were tight but you are expected to react in a split second with button presses that take ages to translate into character actions.<br /><br />I'm sure this game is good, but I wish I could press a button and skip the fights.  It's seriously the worst part of the game and I am surprised that no one mentions how annoying it is.",

Townspeople say generic things and most of the settings look like animatronic rides that cycle animations...all the people look wooden.<br /><br />The story is kind of OK.  I am 10 hours in and just don't care about it.  Alphen and Shionne have a ridiculous relationship where they love each other one minute and hate each other the next.  The little interstitial dialogues you activate with R1 (when you notice the tiny message in the bottom right corner) paint Shionne as a weirdo...in these, she's goofy, hungry, absent-minded, etc. but in the main game dialogue, she's an icy cold princess who will destroy anything in her path.  None of the characters are well developed and it's hard to care about them at all.<br /><br />The music is garbage.  It's the usual symphonic mess that all blends together, sounds exactly the same as every other game, and offers no emotional cues other than annoyance.  I turned it down to 10 in the menu, as should you.  The voice acting is OK but the characters repeat the same phrases during battle over and over again in either Japanese or English.  The Japanese-to-English translation is also pretty liberal and I switched over to the English-only option because my ears were hearing things that the subtitles were not saying.<br /><br />The battle system is stupid.  All enemies, even the low-level trash mobs, have a ton of HP and take an excessive amount of time to clear as you don't do much damage unless you get the ultra-precise combo strings every single time. You can also just run in circles to avoid damage but, since you don't do much damage yourself, it takes way too long to take out even weak enemies.  It got to the point where I was trying like hell to avoid battles...but then this game requires you to grind battles to get any kind of levels to face bosses.  You also don't get much money to upgrade your gear.  Bandai Namco wants you to buy upgrades (+5 levels, 100000 gald, etc.) with real cash and the game reflects that in its core design.  It's bullshit that forces you to pay with cash or your own valuable lifespan just to get to the next boring, non-interactive map.<br /><br />The game is pretty lame; it has main characters with nice modeling and various sexy outfits that keep the incels happy but it's shallow, boring, and trite.

Thank goodness I only paid $25 for it, even at that cost it was too much. Another thing that is getting on my nerves with EA is the code needed to play online.

                "text": "Let me start off by saying, this is a BIG mouse.  It is long and wide.<br /><br />In the realm of &#34;gaming&#34; mouses (I don't game) there are many options, but there are few with a tilting scroll wheel.  That severely limited my choices and is what made me pull the trigger on this.  I love the texture, the lights, and the responsiveness of this mouse. The mouse is ever so slightly big for my hand, but it is a right handed grip which kind of tells your hand exactly where to go. The scroll wheel feels of quality, but it is quite stiff.  The cord is braided and light and you can barely tell it is there.<br /><br />My previous mice were a Logitech M510 and LX8 cordless mouse.  These were smaller and ambidextrous and I found the grip to be perfect. In fact I just came across a mouse called the M500 which is corded and has all the features I like.  I may in-fact purchase that one too.<br /><br />Edit:I have used the mouse for a few additional weeks and it has grown on me.  My older mouse makes my hand feel like cramping when I use it.  I however keep my old M510 nearby in case I feel like using the claw grip, but compared to this one it seems so inaccurate and unresponsive.  I am changing my review from 4 stars to 5 stars.____ This is a &#34;palm grip&#34; mouse, no question about that.  But I can move my hand back and still use a claw grip if I so choose, and it feels comfortable.<br /><br />Choosing a mouse without trying it first is difficult.  You can read reviews and they can give you some insight, but it is a subjective experience.  This is definitely one of the ones you should try, along with a few other names like the death adder.<br /><br />Edit: I've had this for 3 1/2 years and it's still the best I've used.  The forward and back buttons are in the perfect spot.  The DPI buttons are conveniently located.  I initially liked the Deathadder, but I now think it's crap.  It feels cheap, the button clicks feel cheap, and the forward and back buttons both double and triple click.  I haven't owned enough mouses to comment on the sensor as some say there are better ones, but it feels 100% accurate for me.  I would say that a corded mouse is infinitely better than a wireless one.<br /><br />With smaller mouses I tend to rest the heel of my hand on the desk and it causes me wrist and finger pain. This allows me to keep my wrist straight.",

My Roccat Kone XTD was beginning to wear after 2 years, so I thought about replacing it with the same mouse. I decided however to try a different mouse that caters to somebody with a different grip.  I don't have much to say, but I will comment on the features that are important to this group:<br /><br />First_ the box. I like the way the product was presented. The box is of quality, but I would love to have it exist in just a clamshell package and a 1 page sheet with info and a link to downloads and any relevant product manual.  Use the money for some other feature, like a second DPI button.<br /><br />Second_ the software.  It's minimalist.  There are adjustments for anglesnap and many other features.  I like that you can control the number of steps.  The Roccat however, the software just blows me away.  It tracks every click and turns it into awards when certain milestones are reached.  It's fun. You can use this information in your gameplay, and it's kind of fun. Oh, I've said that already, lol.<br /><br />Third_ the building materials. The surface is kind of a rubberized material. IDK if it contains latex.  It is comfortable, but I still prefer the build of the Roccat.  This surface retains heat from the user's hand and with use is warm to the touch.  The buttons are LOUD. The clicks feel of quality.  I prefer the clicks of the Omron switches.  I like the braided cord.  The mouse however is too light.  I am however used to the Roccat which is larger and has added weights.<br /><br />Fourth_ ergonomics.  I have a small hand. The mouse feels a little small, but I'm a palm grip user. I bought this because I thought it was good looking and I wanted something different that would make me want to use other grips.  The forward button is a little hard to reach. The scroll feels of quality and the clicks are distinct, but it's a little small. I noticed now that you can't click the mouse wheel right and left.  There are grooves that support your last two fingers, however.The Roccat lacks these grooves, but the height prevents your fingers from touching. The Castor is a little slippery, which makes the lift and drop technique possible.<br /><br />It is quite comfortable, but the biggest flaw (to me) is the lack of height from the heel, but this comes from a person who prefers a palm grip. This is a fingertip style mouse, which the Roccat does quite well. Claw grip work best with tiny notebook style mice.  FOUR stars **** .  I would not buy again, but I think it's a good buy, especially at the now lower 38 dollar price tag.  Enjoy! I hope I was helpful.",

                "text": "I just purchased this and have not owned it for long, but I was anxious to type at length.  The main reasons I purchased this board were for it's hotswap capabilities as well as the low profile/zero tilt case.  For some reason flat enthusiast mechanical keyboards are almost unheard of.  I have lower profile board in space gray, with Halo Clear switches.<br /><br />Keycaps-  The keycaps are certainly better than average, and they better be for the cost of this board.  I prefer PBT- I like the harder material, the sound, and the rougher texture.  However, these are almost too rough- they are gritty like sandpaper.  My favorite keycaps are Leopold.  Just to compare the keycaps on the Anne Pro II are also PBT, but they are pretty smooth and not ideal.  I like the font and the shine through legends.  On two sides they measure 1.33mm and the other two 1.01.  I'm not sure why they are not even all around.  The are OEM profile and have a pleasant sound. I may replace them, but am not rushing to do so.<br /><br />Switches-  This board has Halo Clears, though there are about 1/2 dozen other choices available.  These are rated at 63 grams I believe, but they bottom out at 80 grams.  They are heavy.  The are smooth and have good tactility- and I like the force curve.  They all ping like crazy however which annoys the heck out of me.  I like these a lot, but I will be swapping the springs out for lighter ones.  There is minimal switch wobble, but I think the heavier springs help to mitigate some of that.<br /><br />Case-  the case is flat and low profile which I like.  It is aluminum which I'm neutral about.  I'm perfectly fine with plastic and the metal adds cost to the whole package.  This is a \"floating switch\" design, meaning the bottom of the switches are exposed.  I used to like this, but I actually prefer the more tradition kind where the bezel covers the base of the switch.  The case has zero tilt which was my number one requirement.  It comes with magnetic feet which are quite sturdy and raise the incline about 4-5 degrees.  There are recessed hole the feet go into and the case can even be declined.  Don't worry they are not coming off if you slide the board.  I actually had a really difficult time getting them off after I attached them.<br /><br />RGB-  These can be adjusted using FN plus various letters and there are controls for brightness, breathing, color, scrolling pattern, etc.  I don't know if there is more fine tuning control when you flash the firmware (I just use a dim backlight).  There is also RGB going around the base of the case which I turn off.<br /><br />Stabilizers-  I can detect just a slight rattle in the space bar, but I think the heavier springs help to prevent some vibration. I have read that the stabs are not very good so I have already purchased new ones and will be installing them tomorrow.<br /><br />Software/Programmability-  I have not experimented with this yet.  There is a process to flash the firmware for the layout you desire.  I would remap the Fn to the CapsLock and then the arrows to I,J,K,L.<br /><br />Overall Value-  $200 dollars is a lot of money for a keyboard.  At this price point you can just about build the board yourself and choose the components.  I would have chosen different switches (though I'm really starting to like these) and a plastic case which would have saved money, and different keycaps.  However, I paid $140 for this new on eBay and I feel at this price it is a great value.  Ultimately it was the flat case that made me pull the trigger.  I have heard of people complaining about the rattling stabilizers which they felt should not happen at this price point.<br /><br />I should also point out that there may be some issues with the USB-C cable.  Some cables are not compatible- I believe they need to be rated for 2.4a, and not just data.  I will say that my own USB- Cable would not even fit in the port which was strange- I did not force it.  For people who like to use the fancy coiled cables they may not work.<br /><br />Included in the case is a switch puller, keycap puller, and the feet. The are all wedged in the foam base.",

There are no caps with mold marks or anything.<br /><br />- Even fonts.  They are near perfect.  If I look very closely on just a few caps I can see where an edge is not perfect (noticed on about 2 caps)<br /><br />- Texture is very pleasant.  I like my keycaps with a rough feeling to them.  The keycaps on the DROP board were actually TOO rough. It felt as if they were coated in sandpaper.  These are a tad smoother.  These are very comparable to Leopold keycaps, who make in my opinion the best ones in the biz.  Only difference is these are OEM profile, and Leopold uses their own shorter SS2 profile.<br /><br />- THICK.  I measure 1.39- 1.5 on my digital calipers.  The sound profile is also really pleasant.<br /><br />-  Cost.  I think these are a wonderful value.  I am happier with this $45 set than I am with my ePBT set that I paid more than $100 for.  I will be purchasing more, especially if they offer more colors.<br /><br />CONS___<br /><br />- The colors offered are very limited.  I would like to see more than black, white, and blue,<br />- Some of the keycaps did not fit the proper rows.  For example, the PgUp key which on this board is<br />on the third row was made for the fifth row (it was too tall).  The options were to have them not match the height of their rows, or to leave the original keycaps on from the first set.  I elected to leave the old ones one.  I like the way a few keys look that the darker contrasting keys look.  This was only an issue for Del, Home, PgUp, and PgDn.  The other ones I left in for aesthetics only.<br />- Lastly, very surprisingly there is no 1.25u Fn key.  This is a VERY common keycap that many sets will need. I have 10 boards and almost every one has this key.<br /><br />EDIT*-  This does in fact have a 1.25 unit Fn key- So I'm buying another set!!!",

                "text": "I have MANY mice and am always buying new ones to try and find something better.  I was a huge fan of the Roccat Kone XTD.  It was a little large for my hand, but the shape was perfect.  This is essentially the same mouse but like 15% smaller.<br /><br />When I first bought the mouse I didn't like it and almost returned it.  The case material is pleasant feeling, but slippery and my hand would just slide up the mouse body and off.  I put 4 strips of grip tape on the mouse and it's a whole nother animal.  The tape make it just a hair larger which I like, but more importantly it sticks to my hand.  My thumb and ring finger fit in the grooves perfectly and my other fingers lay on top of the mouse.  I've been trying to find another like this but I haven't.  The closest is the Mionix Castor, which does have a similar shape.<br /><br />Ergonomics is the most important factor for me, but it also has a premium scroll  wheel and quality buttons (My previous Roccat mice had Omron switches, I haven't opened this one yet). There is an LED logo and to be honest I don't know if it is RBG.  I've used the Swarm software really only to change the DPI presets so I have not delved into it too deeply.  I know for some the software will make or break their experience, but for me it is not important.  You can set them (DPI) and use the buttons on the mouse to scroll up and down through your chosen presets.  I am also a fan of the braided cable.<br /><br />The grip is not for everyone and if you have larger hands , I would imagine the smaller size would cause your hand to cramp.  Also, as I said, I found the mouse unusable without sports grip tape.  I prefer wired mice, but I do wish this was available in a wireless variant.",

                "text": "I simply cannot get over the quality of these caps for the little that I paid for them.  The profile is called SEMI, but these are more or less just Cherry profile as far as I am concerned.  I would have to measure them against a different set and the difference would be difficult to discern.<br /><br />The legends on the alpha keys are dye sub and side printed.  The legends on the modifiers however are laser etched I believe it is called and raised.  However, they are on the side of the keycap and will never wear off.<br /><br />What really blows my mind is the thickness.  I measured a bunch of caps with a digital caliper and I recorded anywhere from 1.35mm to 1.5.  Many budget keycaps nowadays are quite thin, but that is not the case here.<br /><br />I do see some mold markings on the underside of the keycaps, but not really visible when mounted.  The spacebar is slightly warped, which is not unusual for PBT at any price point, and it does not affect operation.<br /><br />My only real \"complaint\" is that there are not more color schemes available.  I also would like to see these in OEM because that is my preferred profile.  So yeah.  I will post a pic when I get to it.  I think for the price you can't go wrong with buying them now and using when you  need them.<br /><br />The color I chose is Carbon.  I am not crazy about it but I do like the contrasting red and black with the cream.  I am not very good at seeing and evaluating colors, but the cream color is difficult to match to a case I think.  I completely clashed with the silver case of my Drop ALT.  It probably mates best with a black case.<br /><br />The packaging is rather cheap.  The plastic tray it sits in is flimsy and so is the cardboard box.  However, at this price point that is perfectly fine.  This helps to keep the price low.  If you are looking for a sturdy case to store the caps in this is not it.  If you are check out the Akko keycaps.  They come with a very sturdy and neat folding case.",

I also swapped out the switches (came with Cherry Reds) if I recall and installed Box Browns.  The case is very well made.  I'm also a big fan of the keycaps.  They are PBT and shine through- a pleasure to type on.  They are a little shorter than OEM- maybe Cherry profile.<br /><br />It's been a while since I've used the software- the Durgod Hera Compiler.  I remember it being a bit clunky and awkward to use, but ultimately I was able to program the board to my liking.  I moved FN to CAPS LOCK and arrow keys to IJKL.<br /><br />Some people complain that there are no legs to adjust angle.  This I don't care about and actually prefer flat or a very low angle.  It's probably about 2 degrees.  Overall I cannot find any complaints about this board.  It's competitors would be the Anne Pro II, Poker 3, and the Ducky One.  I have to say I am a huge fan of the Poker 3 and maybe a little bias.  One thing I don't like about it though is the typing angle.  It is much too steep and cannot be adjusted.  It's probably 5 or 6%.<br /><br />EDIT:  I just measured the angle and it is roughly 4.5- 4.8 degrees or so, but I have adjusted the rubber pads on the bottom so it inclines less, so it is probably at least one degree steeper than this.",

I bought the 2DS mostly to play Super Smash Bros, but I have been exploring other 3DS games more than I expected. The 2DS is way better for Smash than the 3DS in my opinion, and the trigger grips make it almost as comfortable as a gamecube controller.<br /><br />I still find it fairly pocketable in hoodie weather and winter, since I can shove it easily into any pocket. It may be a bit more troublesome to carry during the summer, but even then it fits in most of my pants, albeit barely.

                "text": "I'm using this controller to play Steam games – it’s wired and came with a 10 ft USB cable so that made it an easy decision.  I don’t have a use for most of the functions, even though it’s incredibly capable and I gave all of them a test drive.<br /><br />The learning curve for using the features is a little steep at first, but I got used to programming it pretty quickly.  First off the customizable prismatic pipe color is really awesome.  It will lock to basically any neon color in the spectrum, so I was able to make it match my shoes, desktop, or whatever gaming interface I was using at the time.  You can also map the multiwheels under the controller to different functions, which I found convenient in more complex RPGs.  You can also customize the rumble feature and the led lights on the inside of the controller.<br /><br />The software works independently of the XBOX ONE, so I was able to manipulate the functions of it as long as it was plugged in.<br /><br />The aesthetics of this thing are really great – as far as the function goes it’s stellar, as well.  The triggers feel a little springier and cheaper than the standard XBOX ONE controllers, but I got used to them pretty quickly.  Once this thing is plugged in it looks really radical, and I wasn't having any troubles with lag – all the buttons and the analog sticks are super responsive and swift.<br /><br />I like this controller a lot – I’ll definitely be hanging on to it for my PC gaming.",

                "text": "I had been interested in mechanical keyboards for a long time, but honestly I didn’t really know what to expect.  From the moment I pulled this thing out of the box I could instantly tell it was a very high quality piece of hardware.  It has a metal frame with very solid keys.  I eagerly plugged it in and connected my mouse through the port extension on the back of the keyboard.<br /><br />There was a solid, deep red glow emanating from the keys.  Very impressive.  Typing on it is pure joy, despite quite a long learning curve.  I don’t mind the adjustment because it's so pleasing to type on something so well made.  The reason why it’s taken a while to adjust is because the Rapidfire indicates extreme sensitivity of the keys – if they travel just over a millimeter they will signal a keystroke.  This means you have to be accurate and not attack your keyboard like you would with a cheaper brand.  The backspace key posed the largest problem when browsing, as just north of it F11 triggers full screen browsing and F12 opens the source examine pane in Chrome.  A little adjustment is all it took and now I’m learning to quickly and accurately graze the keys in order to type instead of bottoming out.  It truly is a joy to type on the K70 Rapidfire.<br /><br />It’s very comfortable to type on this keyboard.  I usually don’t keep the included wrist rest attached unless I have some heavy word processing to do.  It doesn’t seem like it adds much ergonomically, but it makes a huge difference when cranking out detailed reviews for Amazon :D (I’m on it right now).<br /><br />Regarding the RGB indicated in the name, it’s a nod to the LED Array under the keys, and I’ve only mentioned the ominous red embers.  In order to truly make use of these functions you need to get on Corsair’s website and download the Corsair Utility Engine (CUE) software.  Be prepared when you do – the rainbow of color explosion that happens when you first fire up the CUE program is dazzling.  It gives you a good idea of exactly how much control you have.  It took some learning and a bit of video tutorial hunting but I learned to navigate the program and was creating my own custom color combos and animations in an afternoon – This is especially helpful to label hotkeys for your commonly used programs.<br /><br />Protip: You can download presets for the K70 Rapidfire, but many won’t work by default.  Once you download the *.prf files you’ll need to use a program like Notepad++ to open and edit the name of the hardware in the line of code that says modelName&#62;K70 RGB RAPIDFIRE&#60;/modelName – Make sure it has this modelname (I know the K70 standard models work, but others may too)  This is a new keyboard and it doesn’t have many presets yet, but the ones I use from other models that look great are Poison, Knight Rider, Hologram, and Sonar.<br /><br />The only problem that I have with this keyboard is that it’s spoiled me rotten.  Look how much I typed in this review xD.  I’m going to have to replace my keyboards at the office too :P<br /><br />5 stars.  Get one.  You won’t regret it.<br /><br />(Btw, one sexy feature I forgot to mention that I’m crazy about is the knurled metal wheel in the top right hand corner that controls the volume.  It looks really cool and feels great to use.  It’s the only control that’s not assignable on this keyboard and it doesn’t need to be.  It’s absolutely perfect the way it is.)",

                "text": "Didn't get off to a good start with this headset--one earpiece had a short. A $200+ headset with a short right out of the box? That's not so good. A little twist of the wire fixed it, but still...<br /><br />The good news is it sounds great with an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or PC. Compliments were received for the mic quality (Sennheiser says it is broadcast quality) even when using it for phone calls.<br /><br />The not-so-good news is the audio is lacking when connected to a Playstation or Xbox through the game controller.<br /><br />It's more a problem with the audio outputs of the game consoles than the headset. It's going to take a little more than just plug and play to get the max out of this headset. Without that, you might as well use a $40 headset that is actually plug and play in console controllers.<br /><br />It really needs a mixamp or preamp (preferably one with adjustable EQ) in the game console audio chain to bring it to its full potential. If you don't have one or don't plan to get one, another reviewer suggested going with the Game One by Sennheiser.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a comfortable headset, one that can be worn for hours.<br /><br />Apart from the short, the build quality is high and audio quality, both in the speakers and mic, is outstanding.",

A flat spectrum is also an advantage when it comes to hearing dialog and chat, whereas enhanced bass can make everything sound woofy. If you're looking for a lot of bass, I'd rate these as a 6 out of 10 in that area.<br /><br />The ear pieces are comfortable and full coverage but don't completely shut out the outside world. You can still hear some ambient sounds. The automatic adjustable fit is excellent.<br /><br />The mic is inconspicuous and easily moved around. The lighting is a bonus but only operates when connected via USB.<br /><br />The only negative is the volume adjustment knob has a budget feel, kind of like a toy, but it works fine.

                "text": "Some people have complained about the weight of this headset, but so far it's been pretty comfortable for 2-hour gaming sessions.<br /><br />This is a wireless VR headset, so everything is onboard---and that's why it's a little heavy. The games are stored in memory in the headset itself, and capacity isn't upgradeable. Keep that in mind when you are making a decision between the 64 and 128GB model.<br /><br />Setup is easy. You will need a phone to download and use the app for setup and to get games. Then follow the instructions and in minutes you're ready to play.<br /><br />Graphics aren't going to rival PC or console games---they're a little bit retro in terms of resolution, but that kind of comes with the territory and the small built-in screens in the headset. Besides, that might be a good thing when it comes to VR. If the the graphics are too good, things might get a little \"uncanny valley\" and not so fun to play for long. That's not a complaint, just a personal opinion.<br /><br />The wirelessness is a huge convenience during gameplay---you won't feel a cord brushing against your arms or running down your back. And the controllers are responsive with no noticeable lag. Battery life is good enough for a several-hours-long gaming session.<br /><br />Game availability is coming around, but isn't really vast yet.

You get a bunch of contrasting-color extra key caps to customize the layout to your own liking. And a couple of key cap pullers are included, and a USB-C to USB-A cable (about 5 feet long) is included too.<br /><br />Do keep in mind this is a 60 percent keyboard. It has no dedicated PgUp, PgDn, arrow (cursor), or Home or End or Delete keys. You can turn the JKL and I keys into arrow keys with a Function key + i combination, and turn the Backspace key into a Delete key with a Function key + Backspace combination.  But the function key is on the right side, same side as the i key, and Delete keys, so those are kind of awkward to hit on the fly. To do anything more to add the functionality of PgUp, PgDn, Home, End, etc. keys would require remapping and reprogramming the keyboard, which is kind of complicated and more back end work than I personally want to invest. I like the keyboard, though. I like that it's compact and looks great and has a great mechanical feel when typing. So if you're like me and really want those dedicated PgUp, PgDn, etc keys without going to a lot of trouble, a  solution is to get a separate number pad that can be set aside until needed.  A matching number pad is available (as of this writing). Do a search for the brand name of this one (Womier). Or you could go with a non-matching wireless number pad that won't add an extra cable to your desktop and can be set out of the way easily.",

There is SO MUCH to do in this game!  You get to choose your Life, or Lives really.  I started out as an Angler (fisherman) and it was really fun.  Later, I almost wished I'd started off as a Paladin or Mercenary because I really needed those particular stats to beat higher &#34;monsters&#34;.  Presently, I'm at Hero rank as Angler, Paladin, Carpenter, Cook, Woodcutter, and a Master at Crafting.  Honestly, I'm glad I didn't start out my &#34;main&#34; or first life as a crafter, carpenter, cook, or woodcutter.  Maybe it's ok if you switch often into other lives like Paladin for instance.  I'm finding Paladin to be probably most important as I've got the add-on content of Origin Island and the enemies are even harder to defeat.<br /><br />It's charming, I love the scenery and the characters, and the fact you can buy different houses in different lands and decorate them, also there is the quick travel which helps immensely when you're striving to complete certain quests.  I have played so many hours on this, and still have several lives to start still.  I think sewing will be fun to make new outfits but for now I'm so busy battling I'm usually in my Paladin gear.<br /><br />There is just so much to do in this game it's unbelievable.  You shop, buy, sell, create, decorate, chop down trees, mine, become an alchemist, do witchcraft, craft, make furniture, battle, fish...and going to different lands makes for an amazing experience.  The graphics are great and the details are amazing.  As the storyline progresses as well you are able to add many different parties (like the Princess, the Dark Lord, and many others) to accompany you on your adventures.  When  you level up you get points you can add to you or other members in your party (like attack, intelligence, dexterity, etc).  There is no shortage on what you can do!",

The duration of it in which I play is very short however.  A couple more gripes...your character can walk only a short distance, just by the shops around the small town.  You can't wander into the great outdoors to visit anyone, you can only be magically transported to a certain person's house.  Also, when you pinpoint the building site of each character on a map, you are transported their immediately as well.  You also don't have your own house, which seems like kinda a big oversight, that or they didn't think people would be interested in having their own houses for some reason.  So, every day, you go to play and the game begins with your character already inside the shop (or is it right outside?).  Very very limited freedom in this game.  Also, I bought a big set of Amiibo cards.  The first card was cool, I got to build an aquarium.  The 2nd card however, was of a character I already have in the game and all I was allowed to do was re-decorate or decorate with whatever theme I chose.  I hope I don't have a bunch of matches but it's likely I will.",

It doesn't affect my game play, though, just took a bit to get used to. Both sets of the lights work good. The plastic doesn't feel as heavy-duty as another similar holder that I have but there's nothing that stands out, or that has happened, to make me think it's low quality. I think for the current listed price at $10 it's a good, fair price.",

                "text": "First thing to know and keep in mind is that I'm a newbie to Animal Crossing- about a month into the world of it (so I'm not able to compare to old school versions) and I started out playing Pocket Camp. While I love Pocket Camp and don't want to have to stop playing that version, I just can't do the cost part of it. I was tempted to but thought I'd just put money into buying New Horizons, instead (I'd probably have spent more on Pocket Camp!). We already have a Switch to play on. I'm so glad I got it! It's just as addicting. Purchasing the online code and downloading it to our Switch was a breeze and pretty fast to do.<br /><br />I’ll try to group different points/subjects, regarding the game, in paragraphs below since it might be long and to hopefully help read or skim through. Even with a lengthy review, there’s a lot more to it...especially since I’m still fairly new to it myself!<br /><br />***MULTIPLAYERS*** This may be a long-winded paragraph but I feel like this is one of the most important things to know about this game. Normally, I’m that person that does a ton of research before buying pricey items but I guess since I had been so into Pocket Camp and was excited about getting New Horizons, I didn’t spend as much time researching it. I still would have purchased the game but the main issue I have with it--and my reason for giving only 4-stars-- is because you can have only ONE island PER CONSOLE. It’s a bit frustrating in our house and I could see this being even more disappointing for others (especially if they too didn’t know beforehand). Such as families with more than one kid wanting to play (we just have one child). For example, I was the first person to play the game and set up the island. I remembered seeing something about multiplayers so I later started to play with my daughter and looked up how to do so. We soon figured out that she could have a seperate profile and character but her character has to live on my island and share resources for collecting items and all. This means that certain functions, like naming the island and being in charge of certain things, won’t work for her. Also, we can play at the same time but this can potentially get frustrating since you have to take turns to do certain functions and requires switching back-and-forth between players to do the activity. The assigned leader can do things like sell or craft items, and the follower can only “stand” there and wait until they’re done. The follower can collect items at the same time as the leader but it won’t go into their inventory- instead it goes to a bin at a certain part of the island. They can go and get the items to add to their inventory but it requires going to that part of the island and toggling to become the leader to add the items. It all just makes things a little more time consuming, though it is still a bit fun to play together. For some people this may not even be an issue. For us, we have played Minecraft on Playstation together and assumed it would be set up like that-- you can play in one world at the same time but the screen is split which allows each player/character to go to different parts of the world, do different tasks and get different items...or  even build something together. I personally would really like it if they would allow that to happen on Animal Crossing! Though, compared to Pocket Camp, it is cool to at least be on the same screen together instead of only being able to visit each other’s camps at seperate times.<br /><br />TIME SPENT AND CHARACTER SETUP-<br />Note that this game is very time consuming! It goes by real-life time (at setup you’ll choose your time zone), so if it’s night time for you- it will be night time on your game. Being that it’s so time consuming, It may not be for everyone- understandably! It’s certainly getting me through this time, in real-life, with the pandemic going on and staying at home. You of course can stop playing at any point but to level-up and do different activities, it does take a good bit of time...and patience! While I did purchase this game for me, I occasionally let my 9 year old play and give her a certain amount of time to do so. She gets a bit impatient with it since there’s so many things to do and can take time to do so. Also, as mentioned above, she gets bummed that she can’t do certain functions since she was not the one that set-up the island. The set-up process is probably the longest. You start off with basically nothing and are to build up the island by collecting items and crafting. It can take a while to gather certain items. Also, you’re basically in tutorial mode for a long time (and likely throughout most levels). It takes a good bit of time listening/reading directions from the characters and learning the different buttons, how to move around and the various functions of items.<br /><br />EXPENSES/EARNING: I'm about 8 days into New Horizons and so far I haven't come across any extra real-life expenses required, as Pocket Camp requires. Instead you earn/buy things by spending time playing the game doing various activities. You can also collect bells by selling items and finding bells in various locations.<br /><br />NOOK PHONE: You get an in-game smartphone that tracks earnings, information, map, recipes...and allows you to call other characters/friends, etc. You get one right at the beginning/start-up process.<br /><br />CRAFTING/BUYING ITEMS: There are different ways to obtain various items. There are DIY (do it yourself) recipes that you can earn, buy and receive from characters. They are cards that will list the materials that you will need to gather in order to craft the item. Then you will craft it at the “community” crafting table (or eventually make your own table). Unlike on Pocket Camp where you had to order something to be crafted (and sometimes wait up to days before it is ready), you get the item you craft right away. Though, sometimes when purchasing items you might have to wait for them. There are a few different ways to buy items. One way allows you to purchase, with bells, items like tools and get them instantly. Or you can order rotating items like clothing or furniture and get them in your mailbox the next day (in human real-life time). Also, as you advance in the game, other ways of purchasing become available- like vendors coming to the island to sell.<br /><br />FORTUNE COOKIES- Unless they end up appearing on New Horizons at a later level than I’m at, so far there have been no signs of fortune cookies like those on Pocket Camp.There are prizes that come wrapped as a gift and floating through the sky on a balloon. You use a slingshot to pop the balloon and open your present. Sometimes it’s a material for crafting or a piece of furniture or clothing item. Those are fun! Plus, until April 12 they have a “Bunny Day” event that allows you to collect about 6 different types of eggs that are used to craft Bunny Day recipes (for furniture, outfits, housing materials,etc)<br /><br />OVERALL: My only reason for not rating 5-stars is due to what I wrote above regarding  issues with multiple players on one console. There are TONS more features to the game that I didn’t even cover. I love all the details of the game. As mentioned, I can only compare New Horizons to Pocket Camp but I personally love this one a lot more (though, I loved Pocket Camp too!). Be prepared to put a lot of time into it (especially to get your $ worth!) but if it’s your thing, it is worth it and a lot of fun.",

She comes to the cafe alone - some NPCs bring along family/other characters. I don't have her new Amiibo card, or any other Isabelle amiibos, so I'm not sure if she brings any other characters with those Amiibos.<br /><br />DLC/ Happy Home Paradise: When I scan her to try to design a paradise home for her it recognizes that's it's Isabelle but it says \"You cant connect with this VIP client yet\" so I'm assuming I just haven't unlocked that level yet to design a home for her. ⭐ HOWEVER, when I've completed designing other animals homes and ask to take pictures in their home- it allows for scanning some amiibos into the house to take pictures- it works to scan Isabelle for this feature. I have a Lottie Amiibo so I took a picture of them in Cally's home and posted it on this review to see. It's a lot of fun 😊🥳<br /><br />If and when I get to the point of being able to design Isabelle's home- using this Amiibo figure- I'll come back to update again!<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br />5/2021 Original review:<br /><br />This is my first time using an Amiibo figurine. I've used the cards for some villager characters but not for special characters, like Isabelle.<br /><br />I especially wanted the figurine to keep on display and figured if it happened to work on for Harv's on ACNH (Animal Crossing New Horizons) then it would be a bonus. It does work to use at Harv's. 🔴 Note that you can't invite the special characters to the campsite 🔴 We have both Nintendo Switch and the Switch Lite and this Amiibo works on both consoles.<br /><br />Easy to use, just like with the cards. You place it near the joystick when the Amiibo symbol is on the screen and she pops right on the screen. 🔴 Also note that you can't change her clothes at Photopia/Harv's, you can only change her reactions and move her to different spots.<br /><br />Once she appears there at Harv's, her poster is automatically ready to order on the Nook Shopping app- either from your Nook phone or at the ABD back at Resident Services. Like the other posters, it's 1,000 bells to buy it and it will arrive in your mailbox the next day.<br /><br />The figurine is super cute and in great condition. The box was in great shape, as well!",

Blathers and Tom came out of a box, which I knew before hand that they would, but they each have minor scuff marks so that's a little disappointing but I knew I was taking a bit of a risk with ordering these...and it's honestly not bad scuffing.<br /><br />I wanted them to display as figures and to be able to scan at Harv's Island/Photopia on ACNH (Animal Crossing New Horizons). Each one scanned...nearly all scan quickly except for Reese, which first said there was no Amiibo found but every other time it has worked...though, I have to hold it longer than the others and in the same exact spot on the right joystick...the others aren't like that.<br /><br />As long as Reese still at least scans, I'll keep my rating at 4-stars- if any further mess-ups happen, I'll update to make the rating lower.<br /><br />Also, in case you were wondering, all of these characters, and the other special character Amiibos, are not able to be dressed-up/changed at Harv's. You can change their reactions and take pictures and then once they're scanned, it automatically becomes available to order the character's poster through Nook shopping. Also, K.K. doesn't have his guitar when scanned, so I personally feel he looks very different without it lol<br /><br />All-in-all, other than the issues mentioned above, I love these.

This was the first hidden object game to give the player a 360 view, which means that you can spin around within the scene and see all parts of it, from the ground to the sky.  The storyline for the game is a Paris vacation, and in the game you get to travel around to all sorts of famous and beautiful locations, from various level of the Eiffel Tower to parks, churches, and a country mansion.  The objects are actually hidden in remastered photos of real Paris locations, so the scenery is beautiful. Do watch out when you're moving around a scene, as the picture scrolls, and if I look at it head on when moving it can produce motion sickness.  But honestly, that's not such a big deal: just look down or to the side when you scroll.  This game is lots of fun, and it's fun to replay.  This is a good game for all ages, from elementary school up to adults.",

The storyline for this game places you as a detective, trying to solve the case of the missing diamond from the Huntsville museum.  You investigate a variety of locations by looking for hidden objects.  Each location reveals a new troublemaker, and all of them seem to belong to the same crime ring.  At the end of the game you uncover the mastermind, and discover who's really behind the diamond theft.  There are many good points to this game- the storyline is a good one, and the game definitely makes you want to get to the end so that you can solve the whodunnit.  Huntsville is full of a variety of entertaining criminals who, you'll discover through the levels, seem to engage is some bizarre crimes.  Perhaps most importantly, the pictures in this game are VERY well done.  They're complex, they're funny, and the objects are well integrated into the picture- they're not just plonked on top of a background scene.  As this was the first Mystery Case files game, it's also the easiest.  If you're new to the hidden object genre or looking for a good kid's game, this is a great place to start, but it's also engaging and difficult enough that it should please everyone.  Highly recommended.",

                "text": "This is one of the newer Nancy Drew games, and there's both good and bad to it.  I'll start with the good: the atmosphere of this game is great- very creepy.  An old Irish castle after dark is bound to be spooky, and indeed it is.  The graphics when inside the castle are also fantastic- high resolution, lots of detail.  You really feel like you're in the castle.  Part of the castle has been blown up, and it was never really clear why someone was staying in a room with half the roof missing, but we'll hold that thought until we get to the plot.  Other pluses of this game- it's a fairly long game to get through, and some of the puzzles were quite challenging.<br /><br />On to the negatives: the most important one is the plot.  Quite simply, there isn't much plot- Nancy is searching for her friend's missing fiance, but beyond that, we get little plot development.  On the same note, I found the ending to be quite unsatisfactory.  I don't want to give anything away, so I won't go into to detail, and will just say that the ending severely interfered with my enjoyment of the castle's atmosphere.  Also, I was unhappy with the outdoor navigation in this game.  Outside the castle the player controls Nancy from above, meaning that the graphics are quite simplistic, and it's more like an arcade game than a mystery.  I much prefer to see the game through Nancy's eyes.  In sum, Nancy Drew addicts will definitely want to play this game, and there are certainly things to recommend here, but it's not one of the better Nancy Drew games.  The first third of the game is decidedly the best part, and then it starts to go downhill.",

These suspects are all rather shady characters, humorously drawn, who fit into some amusing stereotypes without being offensive (think the stage diva who can't sing, the kind of shady carnival worker, the stay-at-home mom who has a side job as a bank robber).  As you investigate each character you'll find out if they have an alibi or not.  At the end of the game, you solve a final puzzle to determine which of the five is guilty.

I've always found these games to be trememous value for money- they have lots of levels of play, great artwork, and the story usually keeps me engaged until the end.  Certainly the length and the fantastic artwork hold true here.  Added to the standard hidden object levels are several twists: there are secret shape-shifting objects to be found in each location, and each level ends with a fairly complicated puzzle (again, with tremendous production values).  These puzzles can be quite difficult, and I would definitely have appreciated a skip puzzle button at times, but help can be found online for those having trouble.  The one place where I found this game to not live up to earlier editions was in the storyline- it's suitably scary, but unlike, say, Prime Suspects in which you build up a list of suspects as you go, in this game you just seem to eliminate them (quite literally!) one by one.  That said, the ending is surprising, and with the more difficult hidden object scenes I still give this one a \"5\" even with the issues mentioned.",

Also, there weren't as many locations to investigate as some other ND games.  In particular, there's very little to do in the inn, and one of the things ND games do so well is to set up spooky, old, searchable houses.

The cases are well-written, and the hidden object scenes are appropriate to the time and place in question (late-19th c. London).

The storyline involves restoring the garden of an old house along with the help of Austin, the faithful butler, and the dog (you'll get to name him/her).  To raise money for garden restorations you hold yard sales, selling stuff in various rooms of a very overstuffed mansion.  People show up and indicate what they want, you have to find it as quickly as possible.  There are also hidden coins to earn more money, and a very interesting hint system, that really adds to the gameplay.  This is a game with many, many levels, and you get to make decisions about how you want the final garden to look.  Loads of fun, well worth the price.",

You have to search hidden object scenes for clues, and use those clues to determine who the suspect is.  You'll get clues along the way as to the suspect's gender, height, hair color, etc., and you'll use those to determine who you're seeking.  The hidden object scenes are located around the world, and you'll need to determine where you need to search.  So far, this all sounds good.  The main problem with this game is that there aren't very many locations or scenes, so it gets repetitive VERY quickly.  It's good for approximately two games, then it starts to get boring.  Not worth the money, in my opinion.",

It's important to recognize that the Nancy Drew games have definitely evolved over time, so don't expect a game as flashy and complete as Crystal Skull or similar.  But this game did give the basics that fans of the series expect: a good mystery, and suspects to investigate.<br /><br />The storyline places Nancy in a high school, where an unpopular student has just died.  There are several possible suspects, and Nancy has to figure out what happened to him.  The main issues with this game are that there aren't very many locations to search, and it's a rather short game, compared to later Nancy Drews.  I wouldn't recommend this as an introduction to the series, as there are undoubtedly much better Nancy Drew games, but fans of the series won't want to miss this one.",

This episode finds Nancy at a winter resort in Canada, trying to track down a dangerous prankster who has been damaging the resort's property and harming guests.  There are several suspects, all staying at the resort, and Nancy poses as the new maid to try and figure out who is responsible.<br /><br />Generally this is a solid game- there's lots to do, and plenty of interesting scenery.  The resort is not as inherently scary as some of the other places Nancy finds herself (like old mansions and dark graveyards), but there are lots of places to explore.  My two main complaints were with mini-games.  The first is a snowball fight you have to complete every time you want to go outside.  The second is a board game called \"Fox and Geese\" which took forever to finish and lost its appeal long before that.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend this game, to experienced Drew players and new ones.",

You have to move through multiple parts of the room to find everything you seek.  Sometimes spirits escape and they fly around the room, which can be hard on the eyes.

This episode finds Nancy in Japan teaching English during the day and solving mysteries at night.  Nancy is staying at a traditional Japanese inn, a ryokan, and it appears that there are secrets and mysteries lurking throughout.  Guests have been leaving because they've been seeing ghosts, the image of a drowned woman.  Nancy decides that it's up to her to determine what's going on.  Her investigations reveal that every member of the family that runs the ryokan has deep, dark secrets.<br /><br />The positives: I loved that Nancy went to Japan.  The setting was beautiful, and it was exciting to have Nancy visit a new place.  Many of the mini games focused on Japanese culture and traditions.  This was a long game and I got plenty of gameplay.<br /><br />The negatives: It was hard for me to find the ryokan scary.  It simply wasn't all that scary, even though the action happened at night.  I also found the characters fairly uninteresting.  Usually these ND mysteries have some seriously bizarre characters, but these characters were, well, normal.  I guess normal just isn't interesting.  Because this mystery centers on a family's past, it often seems like Nancy's investigating is more intrusive than helpful.  I also didn't like the way the days were set up- because of teaching Nancy is only free after 7pm.<br /><br />In sum, this is a quality ND game, but by no means my favorite.",

You'll also need to earn money to finance all these things, and keep predators (bears) away from your animals.  I enjoyed this game.  It's long, and you'll get plenty of gameplay for your money.

                "text": "I had some older joy-cons that had drift issues and worn down joysticks. I figured that I didn't have anything to lose by replacing them myself. I had already replaced the joy-cons with newer ones. I will say that it isn't the easiest thing to replace the joysticks, but with minimal knowledge and patience, you can do it. The kit comes with 4 joysticks along with all of the tools in the picture. I used every piece of the kit except for the extra screws and two joysticks.<br /><br />To start, you need to use the star screwdriver to open up the joy-con casing. Once all four screws are out, you need to get the pieces of casing separated using the guitar pick. Be careful to not disconnect anything and set aside pieces as you get into the insides of the controller. Once you have the casing separated, you need to get under the battery. There is one to three phillips head screws (depending on left or right joycon) holding a plastic piece that holds the battery for the controller. Once you have the plastic piece holding the battery off, you will see the circuit board for the controller. Carefully remove the joystick using the screwdriver and tweezers. You will need to disconnect the cord coming off of it. Once you pop the joystick out, you just need to put the new one in the same was and connect the cord to the controller! After that, you just need to reassemble your controller and test it out!<br /><br />The joysticks work perfectly, and I have had no issues with them so far. I still have two back-up ones to replace my current main controllers if needed! I highly recommend this kit.",

                "text": "I’m something of an odd gamer, in that I play one game (World of Warcraft) and use a MacBook Pro with an external monitor, mouse, and keyboard when I’m gaming. I know, I make absolutely no sense, but that’s how I roll.<br /><br />So! I’ve tried a few mechanical keyboards since adopting my current setup. If a keyboard has fun backlighting, I’m drawn to it like a bird to a shiny object. I adore the lighting on the HyperX Alloy Elite RGB keyboard! The default is a scrolling rainbow of colors, but the onboard memory profiles include a blue mode and a red mode. Unlike Windows users, I can’t download their software to get the full customization available, but I’m satisfied with the built-in options. And I know that if someday the apocalypse happens and I switch to Windows, I will have even more options in that area.<br /><br />The volume control is another one of those cool features that I really like. The scroll wheel is amazing for adjusting on the fly, such as if I can’t hear my raid leader in Discord, or my game sound is suddenly booming in my ears. I don’t have to look to adjust, which is a plus.<br /><br />The keys feel amazing. The keyboard is very clicky; the first time I used it, my mom thought I was murdering the poor keyboard. But I like the noise and feel of it. If you haven’t used a mechanical keyboard before, there’s a slight adjustment period. I like the feel of the keys and the keyboard’s quick responsiveness so much that I use it for writing and other work every day, not just gaming.<br /><br />HyperX included extra keys, for 1-4 and WASD. The WASD have a slight texture to them. There’s also a plastic wrist rest you can attach to the keyboard.<br /><br />The only thing I’m confused about -- the keyboard has two USB connectors. Because I use a laptop, I’m limited on ports. I learned the keyboard still works with only one of the USB connectors plugged in. So I’m not sure why there are two? There is a back USB port on the keyboard, if you have the running-out-of-ports problem like me. Lastly, the USB cord is super heavy duty, very thick and braided. It’s almost 6 feet long.",

                "text": "I tried the Logitech G935 Wireless Gaming Headset for about two months before writing this review. I wish I liked the headset better, but after testing it, I’m still on the hunt for the perfect headset.<br /><br />Currently I do most of my gaming with multiplayer Switch games, such as Splatoon 2. I have to use Discord on my computer or phone to talk with friends while we play. But I also want to hear game sounds, so the option to have dual sound inputs is what really drew me to the G935. I connected the headphones wirelessly to my computer and used the 3.5 mm cable to connect to my Switch. A bit messy, but I was willing to accept that if it worked well.<br /><br />But it didn’t. No matter how many sound settings I adjusted, my voice was muffled when talking. I had better results using a normal pair of headphones and the built-in microphone on my computer!<br /><br />Not to mention, finding the proper button I want to use when wearing the headset is difficult. I have to feel and count the buttons, which takes my attention out of the game and performance suffers. I suppose I’d develop some muscle memory if I used the headset for longer, but I still feel like there are too many buttons. And the volume rocker is at the bottom of the earcup, so if you take the headphones on or off, it’s really easy to change the volume and not be able to hear or get a screech in your ear.<br /><br />Comfort wise, I tend to get headaches if a headset is too heavy and/or tight. About an hour was my limit for wearing the G935, or I’d have a headache from the weight of it. The earcups are actually pretty comfy and well padded, the headset is just big and I wouldn’t recommend if you have a small head.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, one of the better parts of the headset. But I couldn’t find a way to adjust the volume on one source and not the other via the headset if I did dual inputs.<br /><br />I just wasn’t thrilled with the G935 headset. At the level it’s designed for, I would have expected Bluetooth connectivity instead of a wireless dongle, better button design/layout, and better comfort overall, not to mention clear voice quality.",

The Logitech was my preferred mouse for a long time, but I’ve been using the Corsair almost daily instead of switching. It’s good for general use as well as gaming.<br /><br />One of the biggest pluses for me is that Corsair’s software, iCUE, runs on Macs. I can customize everything, including the lighting, make macros, change the DPI, and probably other things I haven’t found yet. There’s a lot of options to explore in iCUE, but I think it’s pretty intuitive.<br /><br />I like the hand feel of the mouse. I have small hands; this mouse is comfortable to use for hours at a time. Obviously, everyone has different preferences, and I’m quite picky myself. Hand feel is impossible to test when buying a mouse online. But Corsair has designed this mouse to have three different thumb grips. My Logitech mouse has adjustable weights, which requires a little fiddling. Changing the grips on the Corsair is super easy: they snap into place. Magnets keep the grips on and make a quick switch out easy, if I think I might want a different one when playing.<br /><br />I also like how the scroll wheel feels. It reminds me of a little tire, with its tread.<br /><br />The mouse is lacking buttons for serious gamers. Aside from the usual left/right click, there’s only forward, backward, and DPI up and DPI down. I also have to say I don’t notice any difference between the Corsair’s 18,000 DPI versus the Razer’s 16,000 DPI or even the Logitech’s 12,000 DPI.",

My daily driver is a HyperX Alloy Elite with Cherry MX Blue switches.<br /><br />I’ve put this E-YOOSO mechanical keyboard to the test for about three weeks. The switches are Outemu Blue Switches, which is a knock-off of Cherry MX Blue switches. I definitely noticed a difference between the Outemu and the Cherry. The Outemu are a little noisier and don’t feel as smooth. I feel more resistance when I type on the E-YOOSO keyboard versus the HyperX one. Over a few hours, the resistance adds up.<br /><br />Of course, the HyperX keyboard is more than double the price of this one, but the E-YOOSO is lacking in some basic features that I’ve become used to. There’s no attached wrist rest, and I really feel the lack of it. Muscle memory keeps my wrists up as if there was a rest under them, which gets tiring. There are no multimedia or sound controls on the keyboard; I really miss that easy adjustment when I’m mid game. The keycaps are basic plastic, without any texture. What you’d find on a normal cheap keyboard, and again, this is a matter of preference, but the keys are slippery. Not great for gaming.<br /><br />The silver screws on the keyboard continually catch my eye. This is a minor thing, but I wish the screws were flush with the plastic case rather than sitting above it. I’ve snagged my fingers on the screws a few times. The USB cable is plastic instead of braided.<br /><br />The lighting options are preset, you can cycle through them via the FN and INS keys. I do like that the keyboard includes options without needing to download additional software, but for most people, the first mode (steady rainbow) will be the default. If I’m gaming in the dark, marquee or snake are useless. Another minor quibble, but I really don’t like the orange row of the keyboard, I wish another color had been chosen. The orange just doesn’t fit with the other colors, in my opinion. It’s too similar to the red row right above it.<br /><br />I do like the dust resistance; I’ve had the keyboard sitting out for three weeks and haven’t noticed any dust building up on it.",

I even have light strips attached underneath my desk and on the backs of my monitors.<br /><br />The stand arrives in two pieces that sturdily click together, so it would be easier than it seems to transport this if needed, in the future. The matte black looks nice in person; I was worried the stand would pick up dust, but it’s actually a smooth plastic texture that is easy to clean.<br /><br />But no matter what I try, Synapse will not recognize the stand. I’ve looked up and tried every fix I can find, with no dice. So when everything else on my desk is glowing blue or purple, this stand is doing its default rainbow thing. And look, I love rainbows, but sometimes I want everything to match!<br /><br />So the stand does half of its job: it holds my headphones. But I’m really disappointed that I can’t customize its effects with Synapse. My other Razer devices connect to Synapse with no problems.",

I don’t love the wired Razer, as I’m not a fan of the scroll wheel or the design of buttons 4 and 5.<br /><br />Right off, I noticed that I liked the scroll wheel on the Razer Basilisk X. It doesn’t have as much resistance as the wired version does. It’s a little clicky and has some resistance, but not so much that I revert to using my laptop’s trackpad, as I do with the wired Basilisk.<br /><br />The left and right buttons are nice and clicky. The side buttons stick out a bit more on the Basilisk X than on the wired Basilisk, which I prefer.<br /><br />I have small hands and found the Basilisk X comfortable to use for hours at a time.<br /><br />Synapse 2 on my Mac could not find this mouse. Synapse 3 on my Windows computer did find the mouse. This mouse is only compatible with Synapse 3. On Windows, I was able to customize the different buttons.<br /><br />There’s no RGB customization, as the Basilisk X is the less expensive model. I was sad to see the Razer logo doesn’t light up; yes I’m a dork who likes glowing peripherals.<br /><br />The mouse can be used either wirelessly or with Bluetooth. There’s a switch on the bottom to switch between connectivity types. The Basilisk X uses one AA battery; to help with battery life, I put the switch on BT to keep from accidentally waking the mouse if I don’t have the dongle plugged in. The USB dongle can be stored inside the battery compartment. It’s very small and difficult to remove from a USB port once inserted.<br /><br />In contrast to other battery powered mice I’ve used in the past, the Basilisk X’s battery compartment is on the top of the mouse. The top pops off so easily I’m worried that it will pop off while I’m using the mouse, especially during an intense moment in a game. All it takes is a little pressure in the right spot, and bam, off the battery lid goes. I really don’t like this.<br /><br />I don’t have a scale, but there’s a noticeable weight difference between the wired Basilisk and the wireless Basilisk X. The Basilisk X feels very lightweight in the hand. It’s almost a bit too light for me; I notice the difference every time I switch between the mice.",

This is my first time trying linear switches. The first few days, I felt like I was typing on the softest keyboard ever. I personally like how buttery and responsive it feels, but finding the right switch option is really one of those things you have to try yourself. I did notice that it’s easier to “bottom out” the linear switch versus say, a Cherry MX Blue switch.<br /><br />I have a light hand and don’t do a ton of button mashing with the games I currently play (Warcraft, Paladins, SDV), so the Origins Core has replaced my daily driver, the HyperX Alloy Elite RGB (with Cherry MX Blue switches). I do miss the volume rocker on the Elite RGB, but that’s all I miss.<br /><br />The Origins Core does have function keys (FN + F#) for volume, media control, and light profiles.<br /><br />Getting back some of my desk with the Tenkeyless version is another plus, too. The keyboard is small enough that I actually would travel with it, if I were going somewhere for a few days. The USB cable is detachable, which makes it easier to transport.<br /><br />I use this keyboard for both writing (at least 2-3 hours of typing a day) plus gaming. I like that HyperX has built angles of adjustability into the keyboard feet. I can have a 3°, 7°, or 11° angle. The keycaps are a little slippery during extended gaming sessions, but this hasn’t bothered me enough to replace them.<br /><br />The keyboard itself has a good build feeling to it, and it doesn’t slide on my desk, even during intense moments.<br /><br />I did try HyperX’s NGENUITY software to make my own custom lighting profiles. The software is only available on Windows, but the keyboard can save 3 profiles to its onboard memory. I switch between Windows and Mac, so I was excited that I could customize the keyboard on my Windows machine, and be able to use those light profiles on my Mac without needing the software. NGENUITY allows a LOT of customization; I spent a few hours playing with the different lighting options. I like NGENUITY more than Synapse.<br /><br />I have one little quibble. I wish the lighting for the caps lock key was on the key itself, instead of above the arrows. But that’s a tiny little complaint, it doesn’t interfere with my use at all.<br /><br />I recommend going with the RGB version; you can always set a solid color. The RGB lighting is so much fun, and I dare I say -- it’s pretty!",

I almost wish I was a streamer, so I could show them off!<br /><br />The headphones are very comfortable. They’re heavier than other pairs I own, but I don’t notice that when wearing them. The headband is padded. The ear cups are too, fitting comfortably over the ear. The headphones stay in place without squeezing my head too tight, which is important for me, as I get headaches when headphones are too tight. The headset has measurements on each side, so you can keep track of what is the perfect fit for you.<br /><br />These days I generally prefer wireless headphones for the convenience, but I’ve been reaching for the Kraken Kitty pair instead, so that should tell you how much I like the comfort/style.<br /><br />The mic is retractable, so when I’m not using it, I don’t even notice it. Sound quality with Discord and the mic has been good. The sound quality of the headphones is good too, though they don’t do noise cancelling. Just the mic does noise cancelling.<br /><br />While I love the kitty ears, there are a few downsides to this headset.<br /><br />One: changing the color from the default Razer green requires Synapse 3. Synapse 3 is still in beta, and only runs on Windows machines. I only have Synapse 2 on my Mac, which is my main computer for using Discord while I game.<br /><br />Two: the cable is not removable. I had hoped to get an adapter and make the Kraken Kitty a Bluetooth headset, but then I’d have a 4 foot cord hanging off my ear. The cable is a strong braided one (like all Razer devices), but I do worry that it will wear out, or I might run it over with my chair. Then I’ll be stuck with a headset I can’t use anymore.",

The clamp fits securely on my desk; it does take some strength to pull the clamp apart. Each side of the clamp has a thin layer of foam padding to protect the surface.<br /><br />The clamp needs about 2” of space to get a grip, so if you have a desk with a narrow lip, you’ll probably knock it off.<br /><br />The stand portion can rotate, which is nifty. I can put my headphones on it, then rotate the stand so the headphones are even more out of the way.",

                "text": "I wanted a glowing controller for my Nintendo Switch from the moment I bought it. But the options haven’t been great, not until the Afterglow Wireless Deluxe Controller was released.<br /><br />I like this controller a lot. I’ve tried quite a few, including Nintendo’s Pro Controller, but the Afterglow is my favorite. Not just because it glows, but because it feels nice in my hands. I have small hands, so I want a lightweight, easy to hold controller. The Nintendo Pro Controller felt nice, but I didn’t like the matte finish on it, nor how that finish felt against my hands after playing for a while.<br /><br />The Afterglow controller is compact and lightweight. It has a plasticy finish that I like. The A/B/X/Y buttons are quite clicky, with some resistance behind them. The joysticks are taller than the ones on the joycons, so that takes a bit of adjustment. The big button on the back of the controller is a bit weird, but it can be disabled.<br /><br />Lastly, the Home button is really close to the X (and the + is really close to the Y). I’ve accidentally hit the Home button more than once in the middle of a FPS match, which isn’t ideal. And I have small fingers!<br /><br />But now, let’s talk about the glowing, because that’s one of the best parts for me. The controller is transparent, so it looks cool even when it’s not being used. There are different glow modes: set color, fade in and out to set color, cycle through all colors, and react to movement of joysticks. So there’s a lot of customization and color options. The controller looks the best in the dark, but it’s not too shabby in the middle of the day, either.<br /><br />So, even though I have a few small quibbles with the button placement, the lighting is honestly enough to make up for that.",

                "text": "I like HyperX keyboards a lot. For the last several months, my daily driver has been their Alloy Origins Core Tenkeyless, with their HyperX Red switches. I usually write several thousand words a day, so I liked the switches for comfort, the RGB lighting for fun, and the keyboard as a whole for being able to switch seamlessly between work and gaming.<br /><br />Enter in the new HyperX Alloy Elite 2. I haven’t touched my Origins Core since unboxing the Elite 2! The Elite 2 is full-size, with num pad and media keys, so it takes up a bit more space on my desk. It’s heavier too, weighing in at 3.3 pounds (1530 grams) compared to 1.98 pounds (900 grams) for the Origins Core.<br /><br />But I’m fine with all of that, because the Elite 2 looks SO COOL.<br /><br />The ABS Pudding Keycaps are hands down the coolest part of this keyboard. The sides of the keycaps are translucent, which allows a ton more light to shine through. The top of the keycaps are black, and actually look like they are floating on a sea of LED light. If you like your keyboard to light up, it doesn’t get brighter or cooler than this.<br /><br />At certain angles, you can see the red of the switches.<br /><br />I’m already used to and like the company’s HyperX Red switches. Switch preference is a personal and tactile preference, but I will say that for me, these switches feel like typing on air. Performance feels good, though I do think it’s easier to bottom out linear switches compared to clicky switches. I play Paladins and have a light hand; this keyboard works well for me in that game.<br /><br />I use the keyboard with Windows and Mac computers. Another thing I like is that the keyboard has 3 onboard memory profiles, so I can use HyperX’s NGENUITY software on my Windows machine to customize profiles, plug the keyboard into my Mac, and be able to use those customized lighting profiles.<br /><br />I’ve also tried HyperX’s first Alloy Elite keyboard, and like the Elite 2 much better. My first Elite had Cherry MX Blues, and I definitely prefer the HyperX Red switches on the Elite 2. I do want to point out that the Elite 2 does NOT include a wrist rest or different WASD keycaps.",

The sides of my laptop block any view of the lighting.<br /><br />And I have a 13” Macbook Pro, so a larger laptop will block even more. The only way I can see the lighting effects is if I look underneath my laptop.<br /><br />When I took the stand out of the box, one of the foam blocks meant to hold the laptop in place fell off. I stuck it back on, but naturally, that makes me worry about it falling off again and my laptop sliding off.<br /><br />The stand does have an extra piece that can be put in the front slot, for use with bigger laptops. It does impede using a touchpad but provides extra stability.<br /><br />The USB ports are really high on the back of the stand. If your laptop has a thick lid, the lid might cover or come very close to the ports. The stand is powered by USB-C, the box includes a USB-C to USB-C cable and a USB-C to USB-A cable to accommodate all laptops.<br /><br />Depending on where your laptop’s vents are, the top portion of the stand might block them.

I love pudding keycaps because the translucent sidewalls really show the RGB backlighting. If I have a backlit keyboard, I want to *see* the lighting, y’know?<br /><br />The white tops of the keycaps makes the rainbow backlighting pop even more. Visually, this keyboard looks great. The backlighting turns off after 1 minute of inactivity.<br /><br />The default lighting mode is a solid rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. Pressing FN \\| switches between the other modes available. To me, most of the other lighting options were gimmicky. One is no backlighting, and the keys light up as they are pressed. Another is rapid breathing. One more is no backlighting and the row lighting up when a key is pressed. And so on. For me, those options are more distracting than having a solid rainbow, or the other sorts of effects I can create with keyboards that have software.<br /><br />The instructions say there is a Mac mode. As far as I can tell, the Mac mode turns the Alt key into the Command (⌘) key, which is very strange for muscle memory. After a few minutes I switched back to Windows mode, which uses the Windows key for the Command key, like most keyboards do when used with a Mac.<br /><br />The top row looks to be the F1-F12 row … but it’s not. It’s actually default to be 1, 2, 3 etc. -- but the printing on the keycaps shows F1, F2, F3, etc. This tripped me up the first time I used the keyboard.<br /><br />My daily keyboard is a TKL, so when I first tried this one, I greatly missed the arrow keys. I wish the printing on the keycaps showed the alternate key options, like a left arrow on the ALT key, or a number on the corresponding F1 key.<br /><br />The Blue switches are loud and clicky. If this is your first mechanical keyboard, everyone in the house will know you’re typing. I wouldn’t recommend this keyboard for an office environment due to the noise. I’m not complaining about the noise, just mentioning it in case this is your first mechanical keyboard.<br /><br />Connecting the keyboard via Bluetooth was very easy, I simply turned it on and held down FN + P for pairing mode. When using the backlighting, the keyboard battery lasts for about 5-6 hours. The space bar flashes to indicate when the battery is getting low. The included USB cable is USB A (computer) to USB-C (keyboard).<br /><br />I am not currently gaming, so I used this keyboard for a lot of writing. I didn’t notice any lag connected via Bluetooth.

I really like that keyboard and the linear switches, but it takes up a little too much room on my desk. So I like the smaller form factor of the V3 Mini, and the Bluetooth/wireless connectivity options.<br /><br />The V3 Mini is 65%, which is another plus for me. I tried to go down to a 60% but I can’t live without arrow keys. It does take a few days to get used to the placement of the arrow keys on the V3 Mini, but I use them constantly and like that the keyboard has them.<br /><br />I’m currently not gaming, so my main use for the V3 Mini has been writing and work. I usually write 1k a day if not more, and I’ve noticed my wrists ache after a long writing session. The keyboard is high profile even at the lowest height setting.<br /><br />Battery life is abysmal. “Up to 200 hours” is only achievable without using Chroma backlighting and HyperSpeed. The battery indicator is on the back of the keyboard, so I was shocked the first time I ran the battery down. That was after 2-3 days of use. I get about 15-20 hours per charge (and charging takes about 5 hours) with backlighting and connected via Bluetooth.<br /><br />The switches aren’t silent, but they aren’t as loud as many mechanical keyboards. I think “Silent” is something of a misnomer here. Going on semantics, I expected a silent or nearly silent keyboard. As I said, the switches aren’t as clicky as others, but I can hear myself type with over-ear headphones and music playing. They do feel nice to type with, very responsive and quick.<br /><br />The steal pudding keycaps are cool but not quite pudding caps in my eyes. The stealth bit means nothing shows on top of the keycaps when the keyboard lighting is off. The letters are printed in a smoky color that blends into the black top. When the Chroma lighting is on, the letters light up. The bottom half of each keycap is also smoky-transparent, so it gives the illusion of a pudding cap, but does not allow as much of the lighting to show as a true pudding cap does. I swapped some of the stealth keycaps for regular pudding keycaps and the difference is very noticeable. I mention this because I cranked the Chroma lighting to its highest brightness when I had all stealth caps, which contributes to lower battery life. Maybe it’s just me, but if I have backlighting on a keyboard, I want to see it.",

Headphones that are too heavy or tight give me a headache, and many of the headsets designed for male gamers are just too big for me.<br /><br />The G435’s are VERY light, weighing in at 5.8oz. That’s light enough to dangle off my pinky finger. Some comfort is sacrificed to reduce the weight -- the headband has no padding. A tightly woven mesh sleeve covers the top portion of the headphones, I can easily feel the frame. I can see the mesh getting snagged if you put these in a backpack or bag, it’s not super durable. The earcups are also some sort of mesh, which I found comfortable for a few hours, but not a super long gaming session.<br /><br />The earcups do not “lock” or click into position. So every time you put them on or take them off, the earcups slide up and down, and you have to readjust the fit. The earcups are on the smaller side; these headphones are best for kids, teens, or adults with small heads. The description says, “fits a wide range of people but designed for younger players with memory foam ear cushions and sizing for smaller head sizes.” Definitely younger and smaller head sizes, not a wide range of people.<br /><br />Sound quality is on the lower end of average. Not quite tin can, but “hollow” is the best way for me to describe it. Quite frankly, I expect better from Logitech. I don’t use a gaming headset for just gaming -- I use a headset for everything, including listening to music and watching tv/movies. When I was trying the G435’s and listening to music or watching a show, I found myself reaching for my usual headphones because the sound was just not great.<br /><br />The headphones do not have any play controls on the earcups, only power, volume up/down, and a mute button.<br /><br />The headphones have no noise cancelling, and in fact, I thought they magnified background noise. My mom watches videos in the next room and I could still hear her videos over whatever I had playing when using the G435’s. I have other headphones that don’t have noise cancelling but they still block out the background noise. Not so with the G435’s.<br /><br />Battery life is really good. I did get about 15 hours right out of the box. The headphones charge via USB-C. They are only wireless via the Lightspeed adapter or Bluetooth.<br /><br />Overall, these headphones are a mixed bag for me.

The white USB-A cable is not detachable.<br /><br />The keyboard comes with a keycap puller and a switch puller, and 6 extra switches (2 blue, 2 red, 2 brown) so you can try the different types. The keyboard is hot swappable (3 pin switches), so you can swap the brown switches for different ones. The installed switches are difficult to remove; I scratched the frame when trying to change some of them. The keyboard frame is shiny silver with a slight texture, so thankfully the scratches aren’t super obvious.<br /><br />The instructions are in Chinese and English, the English side is … not very clear. For example, the instructions indicate I can change the backlighting color, but this keyboard only has white backlighting. And so on.<br /><br />The brown switches are okay. Switches are really a matter of personal preference, and trial and error to find the best ones for you. Browns are tactile, basically between red (linear) and blue (clicky).",

                "text": "This is a review for the Roccat Burst Pro Air, the new wireless version of the Burst Pro.<br /><br />“Lightweight” is a bit of a misnomer, the mouse weighs 81 grams. That’s a little heavier than some other wireless gaming mice, but to be honest, once I started using the mouse, I didn’t notice the weight. It’s balanced really well, and the mouse skates are buttery smooth.<br /><br />The mouse is comfortable in the hand, and this is coming from someone with small hands. I am really picky about mouse feel and shape, this one just feels good. I use a palm grip, so the bump at the base of the mouse gives a lot of space for my palm to rest.<br /><br />The RBG lighting looks so cool! I have the white version, so the lighting is very obvious. I like how the colors shine through the honeycomb design. Roccat’s software allows you to customize the lighting and other functional things, like remapping buttons, creating macros, DPI switcher, etc. The software is Windows only. The mouse can store five onboard profiles, which is nice. If I use the mouse on a different computer, I don’t have to download Swarm and re-customize everything.<br /><br />I’m not a big fan of the M1 and M2 buttons. This is my first time using Titan optical switches so maybe that’s why, but the buttons have a bit too much resistance for me. It takes effort to click. Not mushy, but there’s some resistance. I haven’t gotten used to the M1 and M2 buttons after using the mouse for a month. The other buttons feel better, including the scroll wheel.",

The case doesn’t support wireless charging, it charges via USB-C.<br /><br />The earbuds come with 3 sizes of silicone tips to help get the perfect fit. I’ve tried a lot of earbuds; I have inner ear piercings so many earbuds are not comfortable to wear for hours at a time. These earbuds are super comfortable and fit with my piercings (daith, rook, tragus). The earbuds can also be used independently, so you could use just the left or right earbud if desired.<br /><br />The earbuds have touch controls, I’m not a big fan of them. It’s very easy to activate a control without meaning to do so. I kept triggering the controls when inserting the earbuds, and then couldn’t figure out why one was off.",

                "text": "The Uciefy U26 Wireless RGB Gaming Mouse is … okay. Would I consider it a gaming mouse? No. It lights up, but lights do not make a gaming mouse. The right and left buttons take force to press. If I’m rapid clicking in a game, my fingers are going to get tired very quickly. Other than M1 and M2, the mouse only has forward, backward, and DPI adjustment buttons.<br /><br />Here’s the biggest strike against this mouse: it doesn’t track on dark mousepads. I was using a light blue desk mat and the mouse worked fine. I switched to a black mat, with a dark green and gray design, and the mouse suddenly stopped working. I flipped the mat out of the way, the mouse worked again. Most gamers I know have dark mouse mats or mouse pads, so that’s a big minus.<br /><br />The mouse connects via wireless dongle, Bluetooth, or wired. The included cable for wired/charging is USB-C, and it’s actually quite nice. The cable is braided, so it lays flat on the desk and isn’t too stiff.<br /><br />I connected the mouse via Bluetooth to my Mac. Connecting is easy, but the LED indicator for the mode is on the front of the mouse while the button is on the bottom. So if you’re switching modes, you have to hit the button and turn the mouse over quickly. And there’s no label on the front to tell you the different modes, you have to remember the order or check the instructions.<br /><br />As for lighting, the light mode can be adjusted, but only the light stripe around the bottom half of the mouse is customizable. The other spots light up green when using the mouse. I do like that the mouse doesn’t have any branding on it, the logo on the base of the mouse is a fierce cat.",

                "text": "This review is for the Logitech G735 Wireless Gaming Headset. The headset is part of the Aurora collection, which combines aesthetics and comfort, especially with “fit for all gamers inclusive of smaller head sizes.”<br /><br />That IS the biggest plus for me: these headphones are insanely comfortable. The ear cups are well padded and so is the headband. This is a headset I can wear for 7 or 8 hours and not get a headache. I rotate between headsets and earbuds because most headsets give me a headache from pressure and weight after a few hours. Not the G735s.<br /><br />The comfort is the only reason I keep using them, because nearly everything else is subpar. I expect better from Logitech, and I definitely expect better performance for the high price.<br /><br />I’ve used the headphones for over a month, so I’ve spent plenty of time with them. One of the biggest annoyances is they seem to amplify ambient sound. Part of the reason I use over ear headphones is to block out the annoying noises in my house. Right now, I have the headphones on and music playing. A family member is on the phone in the next room, I can hear every single word of their conversation and the TV show they’re watching. If I take the headphones off, the ambient volume actually drops. It’s like the headset is a mini echo chamber for outside noise.<br /><br />They shut off randomly and without warning. That is not ideal, especially when gaming! If I’m playing a console game and using Discord on my phone or computer, I don’t always realize the headphones shut off until I get messages asking why I’m not responding to chat.<br /><br />The headphones also have volume inconsistencies. This happens when audio pauses, due to buffering or if I pause playblack of music or streaming. After the pause, the audio will jump up in volume. Ear blasting volume. I jump every time it happens.<br /><br />The firmware is up to date, so I know that’s not contributing to the random shutoffs and volume jumping.<br /><br />Logitech G HUB is required for all customization. The headset connects via Bluetooth or wireless dongle (LIGHTSPEED USB receiver). G HUB can’t find the headset unless connected via wireless dongle, which is a pain.<br /><br />Once G HUB finds the headset, you can customize the sound and lighting effects. I was disappointed there weren’t more presets for lighting built into the headphones, it would be fun to change that on the fly, rather than needing G HUB.<br /><br />Battery life isn’t great. I get about 10-12 hours with lighting, and maybe 20 with the lighting off. Turning off the lighting is supposed to get up to 56 hours, I did not have that experience.<br /><br />Overall, while the headphones are extremely comfortable, I can’t get past the poor performance.",

I’ve used some grips that were very hard to put on, in comparison these were a breeze.<br /><br />The grips can be positioned however you want: up, down, or sideways. I did not notice any impact in play performance from the irregular shape of the squids.<br /><br />I played a few rounds of Splatoon 3 to see how well the grips would stay in place. I don’t use motion controls, so I use the joysticks for all movement and aiming.

                "text": "I used my Sennheiser Game One's as a comparison. In their heyday they were in the $250 range (although they are half that price now, oh technology why do you hate my wallet so much). Anyway, I figured they would be the best set on hand I could test against. Both sets were tested on my system with a dedicated sound card (soundblaster Z) and on my hubby's system without a dedicated sound card. I tested for PC use only, so if these are for an xbox keep that in mind.<br /><br />Need for dedicated soundcard: First off, while the Senn's require the soundcard to pull enough power and not crash my computer, the Astros proAmp thing either compensated enough to not need one, or this headset is fine without a sound card. Either way, I did NOT need a dedicated soundcard for the Astro's.<br /><br />Overall sound quality: ok the Senn's sound slightly richer. Not above and beyond but the sound seems \"warmer\" and more immersive. I'm not saying the Astro's were bad, they passed all the sound tests I ran with flying colors, pulling in a wide range of super low bass and super annoying high frequency. I'm just partial to the Senn's, but the Astros were excellent in their own right.<br /><br />Microphone: Ok this is where the Astros shined. They isolated the noise better, voice was much clearer, and they triggered Discords auto-enable flawlessly. My Senn's often clip the start of my words even on the highest sensitivity.<br /><br />Muting: Going with the Senn's on this one, flip mic to mute is just awesome. Astros have an inline mute, that you slide. When muted the LED lights on the proAmp turns red which is a nice visual to know you are muted. Flip up mic is more of a preference, but I’ve heard enough drama in discord from people forgetting to mute than it’s a life choice more than a preference :P<br /><br />Fifth, comfort: Senn's win this one with a caveat, they are a lot warmer. All that super cush comes at a price, they make your head hot after a bit. The Astros weren't as squishy soft, but they are better ventilated and lighter.<br /><br />Conclusion: Compared to my Senn’s I say they average out to being equals. Sound is great, the mic is amazing, and all the replaceable parts on the Astros incase they wear out make these a really great set. The only real negative is the instruction sheet. IT IS AWFUL. Seriously they wrote it in like 3pt font in light grey. They have a diagram on one side that is rather pointless and HUGE, then the actual instructions on the back are super tiny. If I were writing a review for instructions alone this would be 2 star review. Thankfully its for the headset, so I’m only dinging them one star for the terrible instructions, lack of cush on the padding, and the price point. For $250 gaming headset you gotta hit all the categories out of the park. These did well, but my Senn’s are now half that price and comparable in performance.",

I ran a sound check and these picked up bass at the very limits of human hearing, which is quite impressive for an $80 pair of headphones. The mic was crystal clear and did a better job of picking up my voice and blocking background noise than my Sennheisers. Playback of my voice was true, which means if you are looking for a mic that adds a richness and depth that isn't actually present in your voice, this isn't gonna do that. Your voice will sound like... you.<br /><br />The only time I got any static was adjusting the volume when testing for bass, so the drivers were being stressed. Otherwise the volume wheel didn't produce any static.<br /><br />If you want full noise cancellation these aren't going to get you there. I was still able to hear external noise if it was loud, like someone calling for me. But they are much better than open backed headsets, and muffled out sounds like my computer fan and traffic. They also didn't create that weird negative pressure that some noise cancelling headsets create, which was a huge relief. Personally I found these to be the perfect amount of noise cancelling, I like to know that if someone needs my attention they don't have to tap me on the shoulder to do so. Just shout above a normal speaking voice.<br /><br />These are very comfortable to wear, not too heavy but not flimsy light. The ear cups are a standard size, if you have large ears and struggle with headsets in general, you may struggle with these. But I would not call them smaller than average. They were a bit warm though. So if heat is something you are looking to avoid, I would say switch to an open set instead, those are better ventilated although they don't do anything to block outside noises.<br /><br />Overall this is a great headset that performs well above it's pricepoint. Which is surprising since Alienware anything is notorious for being super overpriced, lol.",

                "text": "When I got this I was a bit disappointed. Kiddo has an entry level gaming laptop (he's almost 8, entry is about all I trust him with right now) that gets full rather easy and the biggest space hog is his Steam library. I was hoping this would be a quick fix to moving the games off his laptop without a loss of performance. But moving the games took FOREVER and he kept knocking the external SSD around on his small desk. It also gets a bit warm when taxing it, so I called it a fail, and just ended up upgrading his internal M.2 SSD instead.<br /><br />Since I was stuck with this thing, I decided I would use it as a temporary drive for my desktop. I needed to replace my rather old internal HDD and I didn't want to crowd my second smaller drive. My system is quite a bit better than the kids, with a newer i-7 Intel processor and a freshly installed vid card (GeForce RTX 2080 Super). This made all the difference, the file transfers zipped along including my Steam library. I was able to play games directly from the drive without a noticeable drop in performance, although I play things like Rimworld and Terraria, so I may not tax it as much as some of the more graphic heavy games out there. I was scared to test Ark, that poorly optimized game likes to crash my entire system... @#$%.<br /><br />I did eventually put everything back onto an internal drive, I like having this though as a nice back up and quick way to transfer items. Some things like tax and other important documents I left a copy on the drive. Just in case my system blows up or has a major melt down.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />This SSD Drive's performance is very dependent on your system. Which is going to be true of all similar products.",

                "text": "I really wanted to like these. I have a high end pair of the a50s that I love. Kiddo is not ready for something that pricey, but he would be better off with a wireless headset for distance learning. He has to get up and get papers and such that the wire has become an issue. When these popped up for review I jumped on the opportunity.<br /><br />Fit and Feel:<br />My first concern was unnecessary, they fit my 8 year old on the smallest size just fine and are light weight so he isn't bothered by them. My husband was able to adjust them out to fit his head as well, so I would say these fit a wide range of head sizes. They really do make you look like a Transformer as another reviewer stated, but at kiddo's age that was a plus not a minus. If they weren't bright white it probably wouldn't be so noticeable. He liked the soft ear cuffs, I found them to be okay. Not super plush but not super cheap feeling either. While being light for him was a plus, I found the headset to feel a bit plasticky and flimsy for the price range. He and I agree to disagree on that one.<br /><br />Sound:<br />I like that he can still hear me when he has them on. These are more of a muffled \"open\" headset than a noise blocking \"closed\" headset. If you want to block out the world around you, these are not for you. If you want to still hear people talking and what's going on around you, these are good for that.<br /><br />Sound was just okay. A bit tinny but in this price range most are going to be. At least they aren't over done with artificial bass to make up for it. If you like a rich bass check out Sennheiser, but expect to pay a bit more for it too. The mic was okay sound wise. It didn't pick up much background noise, but it did oddly clip off your last word in both Zoom and Discord. That might be a sensitivity issue on those programs end more than the headset, but it was odd that it did it with both. Our other headsets didn't.  I love the flip up mic, I've heard enough people eating while not on mute to wish that it was a mandatory feature :)<br /><br />Connectivity:<br />Here is where much of our issues stem from. I was willing to go 4 stars up until this point. But, the dongle is a train wreck. First of all there are no included instructions on how to use it and most of the online instructions are for the transmitter version not the dongle. So you will have to dig a bit to find instructions how to set it up. That is unacceptable in my opinion. It is not just pop it in and use your headset, there is a process...<br /><br />Also, the dongle plug is too loose to stay in the usb port securely. It jiggles in his laptop, my computer, both of our usb hubs. I popped it into the PS4 and while slightly tighter still looser than I'd like. It also sticks out a bit over 2 inches when plugged in and easily gets knocked out. It also constantly loses its settings and is a royal pain in the behind. Most likely we got a dud, perhaps trying to get a replacement dongle would fix the connectivity issues, but in all honesty it's just too big to have poking out the side of a kid's laptop.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Faulty dongle and flimsy plastic feel make this mid-range wireless headset a bit of a dud. Sound is tinny but okay, mic is fine and flip to mute is amazing, battery life was as expected. Fits an 8 year old all the way up to a full grown man. Bulky but light weight. If it weren't for the faulty dongle, 4 stars considering the price range.... as it came... 2 stars.",

You can play with friends.  You can play alone.  You can play online.  You want flexibility?  This game trains it and this game has it.  You want to just use it to work out?  Can do.<br /><br />There are beloved oldies, like YMCA.  There are new hits like Roar.  The oldest song I found was from 1956 -- Just a Gigolo.  Flashdance, from 1984 is there is well.<br /><br />You want to sing along?  Great!  You get extra points for that.<br /><br />It's all about the fun.  Yeah, it'll tell you if you mess up, but it'll cheer you on.  It won't boo you off stage like Rock Band can.  If won't stop and say \"let's try that again\" like [[ASIN:B0057PERWU Country Dance Kinect]] will. It won't poke fun.  I suspect the design team never forgot that this is a game and never let it take itself too seriously. The result is that it is just fun.<br /><br />If you've had trouble with other dance games before, you won't with this one.  If you love dance games, you'll love this one.  If you want a fun, heart-pounding work out game, here it is.  If you just want a crazy party game, this is perfect.<br /><br />I just love it.",

In fact, it makes a point of being certain you can hear the world around you.  I guess that has its perks, particularly for those planning to use this out of doors -- and for that application this is a perfect headset -- but it means that the volume comes across as pretty low on the PS4, and it can be hard to hear other players, or even in game sounds.  I tried it with Assassin's Creed IV, and sometimes I couldn't make out what the characters were saying.<br /><br />It does a much better job with the WIi U and the 3DS.  For those, it hits the sweet spot between being loud enough to clearly hear the game, but not so loud as to keep you from hearing everything else.  This is fast becoming my favorite headset for the 3DS.<br /><br />If you want that great surround sound, where the games closes out the world, look elsewhere.

There is an additional attachment to use them for your cell phone.<br /><br />The mouthpiece is detachable, which makes them great (albeit large) for regular headphones.<br /><br />These are powerfully noise cancelling, immersing you fully in the game experience.  The sound quality is outstanding.  They have tremendous range and seem to have some sort of built in leveling feature.

They are fully adjustable, and sit well on the head.  I could wear them for hours.

You can plug the Optical cable into the USB dongle, plug that into the USB port, and go fully wireless.  Or you can use the enclosed audio cable plugged into the PS4 controller.  Both are easy to set up.  Both work.<br /><br />For the PS3, you need to plug the Optical cable into the USB dongle, plug that into the USB port, and then go monkey around with the settings until it finally works.  That one will work, but it is more of a pain.<br /><br />For the Vita, or any other media device, it should be simple.  You just plug the enclosed audio cable into the headphone jack, turn on the headphones, and you're good to go.  Only after a little while it says &#34;Automatic shutdown enabled.  Press the power button to cancel.&#34;  If you press the power button, it says &#34;Automatic shutdown disabled&#34;.  What it does after that is up to a coin toss.  It will either tell you it's powering off and then proceed to do so, or it will stay on.  I've yet to figure out the pattern.  I would have assumed that I did not press the button, or that it did not register, were it not for the audio prompt that automatic shutdown was disabled. I might have blamed it on the battery if it didn't happen less than an hour after a full charge, and right before staying on for an additional 45 minutes.<br /><br />It has little blue Turtle Beach logos on either side that glow red while the device is charging, blue when it is charged, and flashes blue when it is in use.  I would have preferred a stable light to the flashing, or even no light to the flashing.  If I can hear noise, I know it's on.  The flashing is just annoying.  It has separate volume controls for each earphones and microphone, and audio presets such as &#34;bass boost&#34;, &#34;bass and treble boost&#34;, &#34;vocal boost&#34; and &#34;natural sound&#34;.  I favor &#34;vocal boost&#34; for most games and videos, though some games sound better with &#34;natural sound&#34;.<br /><br />They are good for noise cancelling, and the sound quality is excellent.  In &#34;vocal boost&#34; mode, videos level (the voices are not drowned out by the special effects) which I very much appreciate.  Turtle Beach is known for excellent audio equipment, and the sound quality on this is flawless.  Were I judging it by sound alone, it would be five stars.<br /><br />The microphones attaches and detaches easily, for use as a gaming headset or just earphones.  There is a mute button on the right ear, that is quite easy to get to.  The buttons are spaced well enough, and distinctively enough, that they are easy to use while you wear the headset.<br /><br />They are comfortable when worn on the head, but when I wear them around my neck they get grabby with my hair, which is, for me, the biggest negative.",

We run it off a 7.1 surround system, and I've had moments where a twig will snap behind me, or a beast will roar off to the left.  It is a bit more precise that I'm used to in how it handles locating sound between speakers, by firing both off but not at the same volume.  I really love that.<br /><br />The controller is so comfortable.  I had some problems early on with the rubber coming off, but each time Sony was great about quickly replacing the controller.  The audio jack on the controller means even the most basic headset can be effectively wireless for gaming.  I did not think I would like the touchpad, but now I love it.  It has an accelerometer, so for Infamous: Second Son, when you are using the controller like a can of spray paint, you have to turn it sideways and shake it.  And the embedded speakers are such, it sounds like a can of spray paint being shaken.  The PS3 controller always bothered me a little that it is too easy to inadvertently push down the left thumbpad (so it thinks you hit L3) when you are trying to run around.  I've yet to encounter that problem with this one, not even doing the various rundown sections of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag.<br /><br />Sharing in-game video is quick and easy.

In the first section, before even the welcome screen (which is granted something like an hour into the game) I managed to crouch behind something only to have a clipping error trap me there.  I had to go in the world map then back out again to refresh the screen layout so that I can move.  But that's not that bad.  Most of the bugs are gone, and those clipping issues are a running part of the franchise.<br /><br />There is a companion app with a whack of micropay transactions that is pretty much a required part of the experience.  Many chests won't open until you solve a ridiculously easy puzzle in the app.  Easy, because the things you're looking for don't move, so you can just remember where they are for the next try.  That's a little worse, especially because not all mobile platforms are supported.  At the time of this writing Windows Phone (tiny install base, granted) and the Kindle Fire (very large install base) are not supported.  If the thing is mandatory, it should work on all platforms.  The app also allows you to send out your assassin's on assignment, similar to what Ezio was doing in Brotherhood, except it made sense for Ezio to do that.  He was pretty much leading the assassin's at that point.  Arno isn't even an assassin when he starts.  Also, the forgot the initiation rite from Ezio's time or else it changed past all recognition.  The new one is really weird.<br /><br />Also required is the multiplayer element built right into the single player story line.  I mean, you can ignore these things but not if you want to fully complete the game to 100%.<br /><br />The upgrades are tied to helix credits that you can buy, more microtransactions, which can get kind of annoying especially since they start at $20 and go up to $100, but are, at least, optional.  Really optional.  Like if you don't buy air assassination, you can still perform an air assassination, you just have to guess when it will and will not work as the option doesn't show up in the UI.  It's as if they made the decision to implement the &#34;you have to buy this&#34; feature late in the development cycle, so the programmers just hid it from the interface.  You can also do leap of faith before Arno learns it.  In fact, you have to do it before Arno learns it.<br /><br />If anyone was wondering if we lost the modern era stuff in this game, worry not.  It's still there.  Pretty interesting stuff too.<br /><br />Arno is wanted, so much so that if he is seen in a restricted area, no matter how many other random people are loitering around, he'll be pursued.  So with this in mind, he walks into a police station and randomly offers to help with the crime problem.  The only cop on duty isn't all that concerned, neither with a most wanted fugitive standing in front of him, nor with such an odd request, but a bored prisoner sets him to solving murder mysteries.  Why?  Because they wanted murder mysteries in the game.  They're not bad murder mysteries.  They just don't fit in at all.<br /><br />The worse part, is that Arno is the single wimpiest assassin in the entire brotherhood.  Eagle vision wears off in a few moments, and needs to recharge.  He can't escape battle and heal over time.  Like Ezio, he needs healing bottles. Unlike Ezio, he can't find doctors all over the place.  He can't counter and do an instant kill.  He just gets some extra blows in and if he does it wrong he's off balance instead.  His attacks do a lot less damage than any prior assassin.  What he gets instead is...he can crouch.  Yep, we're giving up unlimited eagle vision, healing over time, and a deadly counter-attack for crouching.  Oh, and he can pick locks.  So basically we're trading in an assassin for a cat burglar.<br /><br />If you can, bypass this one and try Rogue instead.  Rogue is the real A.C. game out this year, a true successor to Black Flag.  This one...had potential for true greatness and gave in to mediocre gimmicks instead.",

The adapter has controls to increase game sounds, increase chat sounds, mute the microphone (it lights up if the mike is muted--a very convenient feature) and it can turn up and down the volume as a whole.  The audio cable is standard, so you can use it in anything else that works with a headphone.  The microphone retracts well enough to be invisible if you don't know to look for it.  I used it for a bit with my 3DS and it worked fine for that.  The audio cable is permanently attached, and I do not like that design choice.  The cable is the single most likely part to break (worse for me because my cat chews these cables, but true in general).  A port with a swappable cable would increase the lifespan of these headphones, and would offer choices in terms of swapping to a longer cable, a shorter cable.  A more modular design is always a better choice.<br /><br />It's a good size for a female. The microphone is well places (more on that in a bit) and the headset fits well and is comfortable.  It's lightweight, comfortable, and easy to wear for long gaming sessions.  The padding was soft without being annoying or sweaty.  The ear cups don't annoy the ears the way some can after a long while.<br /><br />As I said, the microphone sits well.  It sits exactly where other headsets I have used sits.  For me at least, position isn't a problem.  The problem is that the pickup is lacking.  If I speak at a normal level--and here I admit to being fairly soft spoken-- it doesn't fully pick up my voice.  It echoes in the headset, and does that very well.  It reminds me of the studio setup I had back when I was podcasting  It's that kind of quality echo back.  That's my largest issue with these, and the reason they lose a star.  They might have gone to three stars but for the sound field.<br /><br />The sound field is astounding.  I had to keep taking the headset off to see if I was really hearing through the headset and not the speakers.  The sounds are directional and adequately distant to give the audio illusion of space and positions in space.  I have never heard audio this good from headsets in this price range.  That's where this headset truly shines.  The sound quality, the range of base and treble, and the sound clarity is impressive as well. In fact, if you're looking for a set so that you can watch shows or play without the noise bothering anyone else, and the mike isn't an issue (or if you naturally have a loud voice) you are going to be hard pressed to find anything better than these.",

He sides with the Templars, not because he believes in their visions of world domination -- and the modern day storyline reminds us that they are the bad guys, this is not a good vs good scenario -- but because he wants to stop the destruction being unwittingly wrought by the assassins.<br /><br />History is still the playground, and we meet some amazing historic figures, the primary one being Benjamin Franklin.

I've played a few games (cough AC Unity cough) where the background noise can be loud and then the dialog drops inexplicably.  This makes it all a bit more even.  The tonal range, bass to treble, is quite good.  I noticed no distortion.  You can hear yourself in the headset, which I find important.  It is very good at blocking out external sound, so don't expect to hear someone calling to you from the next room.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind, the microphone can sort of kind of go in backwards, and it's nasty uncomfortable if you do that.  It should be set up such that the mike is on the left hand side.  I have no idea if it works the other way.  I didn't want to deal with that.  I do know it seems to click in and it stays. I wouldn't think it should make a difference in terms of comfort, but it does.  Even when using them without the microphone, having them not be backwards makes a big difference in comfort.<br /><br />I found these to be snug, but comfortable.  They adjust easily.  The mute button is the only button on the right front, so it is easy to access.  I would have liked a visual indicator if the mike is muted, but that's a small thing.  Again, remember to shut off the chat feature on the Kinect if you want to be able to speak to someone privately (or to not annoy your teammates with the blare of an air raid siren, if you're in a neighborhood like mine that has one -- no air raids, just a peaceful siren to herald in the calm of the weekend).<br /><br />These charge on USB and they charge fairly quickly.  An indicator light on the earpiece tells you if they are charged, and if they are on.  And of course the XBox will show you on screen to whom the device is paired.<br /><br />I know it's not supposed to work with a hub, but I had a spare and I needed this and a keyboard to go into the same port, so I experimented.  I used http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H0PLQHO?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 as the hub and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SVSJ1K?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage as the keyboard and mouse.  I then went into Kinect and turned off the Use Kinect for Chat feature.  I tried first a Skype call (call testing service) to keep things simple, and that worked.  I then tried it in game, and that worked too.  I put them in the port on the side towards the front, not the back port--no choice because the back ports are used for external drives but work mentioning as that has given my trouble in the past with the keyboard and I suspect the headset would fare no better. So if you aren't getting a good signal, try that port.<br /><br />I tried one more thing it's not supposed to do, and it doesn't do it.  It doesn't work with the PS4.  Unusual, since normally any headset with a 3.5mm connection can work with that.  It will function as headphones, but it cannot detect the microphone.  If you want one headset for multiple systems, this isn't it.  If you want a truly excellent headset for the XBox One, this most definitely qualifies.",

                "text": "As has been pointed out, they do not work on the PS3 as advertised.  They are for the PS4 only.  There is a separate audio cable that goes into microphone in and headphones out of a PC.  When I use that, I get sound in one ear only, so not recommended for that purpose.  I'm dinging it one star for lack of PS3 support.<br /><br />They are very comfortable, and both the headset and sound quality are excellent.  Plug them in and the system immediately recognizes them.  I needed to go into the accessories menu and lower the volume, because the mike pickup is very good, and I'm excessively soft spoken,  The poor guy at the deli has to practically lean over the counter to hear me.  These were popping into the red zone for me.  They could easily pick up someone calling in from the next room.<br /><br />The cable is very long, enough so that you can put the controller off to the side without taking off the headset.  This would be useful for a game like Final Fantasy: A Realm Reborn.  You could talk to your friends, while using a keyboard for emotes and the like (is mine the only group that likes dancing in the dungeon?)  The microphone too is fairly long and easy to properly position.<br /><br />They work well with portable electronics.  I used them on an iPad Air and got stereo sound of respectable quality.  Pretty much anything with a 3.5mm jack can use them as headphones.<br /><br />The mute button is easily reached, and one of the main reasons I wanted these.  I'm kind of tired of running co-op missions in Assassin's Creed Unity where the other player doesn't have a headset.  So they can hear everything on my end, and I can hear nothing on theirs, and I figure I'm probably annoying them with the meow of a cat interfering with the in game sound.  So the ability to rapidly mute and unmute depending on who I get paired with matters a lot.  It's really easy with these, even without taking the headset off.  Just slide the only button (and a fairly large one) on the left earpiece and you're either chatting or silent.  Easy.<br /><br />They take no adjustment, but they need none.  They kind of adjust themselves.  They don't get sweaty, even in July.",

                "text": "This is pretty much the sweet spot between a basic wheel that lacks force feedback and a top of the line wheel that costs more than a console.  It clamps to the table (and do clamp it, or it'll go bouncing around if you crash into something).<br /><br />It is fully wired.  You need to plug it in for power, and the cord is pretty short so you may want an extension cord, and you plug the wheel into the USB port on the PS3 or PS4, so you may need a USB extender if you're far from the TV.  I'm playing at about 80 inches from the TV with no issue, but that's close to the limit.<br /><br />The force feedback is adjustable, at least if you're playing Project Cars, and it's a good idea to flip through the options to find the one that's right for you.  It emulates a semi-automatic car with gear shifting paddles behind the wheel.  Project Cars at least responds to that.  Since I've never driven anything but an automatic, I'm basically flapping them around trying to get a sense of what they do.  The wheel is comfortable to hold and turns easily enough, but with a little more resistance than a real car.  The pedals are big, close enough to the size of the pedals in a real car as to make it hard to notice the difference.  If you are playing on a hardwood floor the pedals will slip around.  Get a welcome mat to put under them when they are in use and they will stay put, this assuming you are attaching the wheel to the table and not going all the way with a frame setup.  The pedals are responsive and adjustable.  In the default configuration the break offers more resistance than the gas.<br /><br />The PS3/PS4 switcher is fairly hidden in the front behind the wheel, as it should be given you will be using that switch least of all.  You have full controls for both, including a dpad, options, share, and the triggers (but not the bumpers L1 and R1 that I've seen) right on the wheel.  Project Cars (can you guess my favorite PS4 racing game?) recognized it with no configuration required.<br /><br />Overall this is a lot easier and a lot more fun than racing with the controller.  I'm having a blast.  Now if only I could stop crashing into the walls.",

I played Forza 4 on the 360 with an economy wheel and had a splendid time of it.<br /><br />Playing Forza 6 with this was an entirely different experience.  My hands were shaking; my heart was pounding.  It has been a long time since a game did that to me.  The wheel fights like a real wheel.  You go into a skid and you need to struggle that wheel to go where you want.  It's not so much strength as skills, and it's amazing.  If you release the wheel slightly, like you might in a real car after a turn, it rights itself exactly as a real car will.  It turns pretty much as much as a real car's wheel will in any direction.<br /><br />You can, of course, attach it to a table or something like -- it connects with a small clamp tightened by two knobs on top that look like buttons (twist them if you're having trouble and the clamps with slowly descend or ascend)  but if you're going to go with a wheel of this quality, you may want to go all the way with a wheel stand.  It makes a difference in comfort and stability.  On the folding table I tried the table tipped, the whole thing shifted around, and it was bad.  With even an entry level stand, so long as it has a board to clamp this too, it is perfect.<br /><br />If you want the most intense racing experience possible, you want this wheel.

I could not figure out how to get to what I was trying to click on.  For the Crunchroll app (one of the few video streaming apps that is supported, more on that later) I had to use the arrow on the remote control (not included, and a useful accessory) to get to the search button.  The arrow is a button that does not look like a button on that controller.  You make the cursor go away by pushing any other button.  The shift is like the shift on a keyboard, not a phone. You need to hold it down to get a capital letter.  With a Lego Yoda game, I could find no way to click on the choice between dark and light side.  Some of the games work, but it's hit or miss.<br /><br />I set the system default language to English, so the games kept defaulting to French. For the farming game that comes with it, I could not see how to swap it before the tutorial began.<br /><br />I am using an Ethernet connection so the system keeps saying it won't download until I connect to WiFi (clearly it checks for WiFi and then assumes I'm on a cellular plan).  This gets annoying.<br /><br />The main feature is its ability to stream GameFly games, but the game lists are paltry.  The plans are by genre, so if you want say family games and action games, you need two subscriptions.  Not that there is much to recommend any of the packages.  Most have few games, and only one or two popular ones per subscription.<br /><br />Forget streaming video.  Crunchyroll, Crackle, and HBO Go were supported, and YouTube of course, but no Hulu, no Vudu, no Netflix, no Amazon Video.  The pickings are sparse. Crunchyroll did not stream cleanly, but rather had an odd border around the video.<br /><br />That leaves the ability to stream pc games to the device, in the odd situation that your PC does not have an HDMI port (a splitter will let you put out to TV and monitor both).

It's extremely light, so it is a comfortable headset to wear for a long gaming session, or a long session of teleconferences, or maybe a bit of both.<br /><br />The second thing is the sound quality. At the price point, I didn't expect much and I was pleasantly surprised. These stand on par with some of the more expensive headsets I've tried. I wouldn't say they're the best -- they aren't going to deliver the quality of a $200 Turtle Beach for example -- but they're good enough for most purposes, excellent for gaming, and a good balance of cost and quality.<br /><br />The headset plugs into a PS4/XBox One Controller (or a Nintendo Switch or a cell phone or anything else with a single jack for headphone and mike) and it comes with an adapter to split the input and output so you can plug it into the PC, and the cord is suitably long for both purposes. The microphone control is on the wire. The headphones fold for easy storage.",

But what can I say, I still love the iPad.<br />Touted as the only wireless controller given the Apple stamp of approval, and the third iOS controller ever made, this Danish designed item packs a lot of punch in a small device.<br /><br />There are two easy-to-use joysticks that really move once you get used to them, a D-pad, X, Y, A, B, and a player readout.<br />But here is where this item stands out, and why Apple sanctioned it, in my opinion...on the top, Trigger buttons L1 and R1 with nubbies to prevent slipping, and behind them an L2 and R2. Micro USB port on the bottom, and Bluetooth on the side.<br />If you are buying this as a gift, know that the above-mentioned is important because it means a greater compatibility with more complex games coming 'round the bend.<br /><br />How amazing to get so much on such a small controller! And that may be a negative for some. As a female, the size is perfect and easy to transition to, but a guy with large hands might have an issue with it. Your middle fingers grip an indentation on the back, I suspect it might get crowded back there for a someone with big paws. There is a snap on piece that might make it more comfortable for men.<br /><br />The charge lasts between 8 to 10 hours.<br /><br />So, like anything, it takes some getting used to. But it gives another functionality to your iPad, and certainly travels well. More options than the Moga.",

While DDR Max 2 is still my all-time favorite (I own Flow, Pump It Up, Into the Groove, DDR Max 1 and 2, DDR Extreme 1 and 2), this game places second in my book.<br /><br />It has good variety in the difficulty levels of the songs. Some I can pass on Heavy easily after a year, and some songs I still can't pass on Standard. There are some really slow songs with a hip-hop vibe and some really fast techno ones, and songs in a whole range of styles and speeds, so whatever mood I am in, I can usually get into a good flow with this music and want to keep working out.<br /><br />There is a training mode just like with DDR Max 2, where you can slow the songs down and gradually speed them up as you get better at each sequence, which is invaluable for Rhythm and Police and Exotic Ethnic, two awesome but very fast songs!<br /><br />The downside to this game is that it doesn't have nonstop mode like DDR Max 2, but the game mode is structured so that you don't have to keep flipping through a ton of menus if you pass each song, so it isn't as necessary as it is with DDR Max 2.<br /><br />I am grateful that DDR Max excludes the dancers as I find them distracting.<br /><br />The (nearly complete) song list (I've starred my favorites!):<br /><br />22 Dunk - Slake<br />5.1.1. - DJ Nagureo<br />Abyss - dj Taka<br />*AM-3P - kTz<br />*Baby Baby Gimme Your Love - Divas<br />Brilliant 2U (Orchestra Groove) - Naoki<br />Broken My Heart - Naoki (feat.

I own DDR Max 1 and 2, Extreme 1 and 2, Flow (the rap DDR!), Pump It Up, and Into the Groove, and this is one of my most-played DDR games because of the awesome songlist.<br /><br />I love how modern and danceable the songs are, and I love that so many of my old favorites are on here (Afronova here I come!). I embarassingly enough love the silly pop songs like Oops! I Did It Again, Crazy in Love, and Genie in a Bottle, and then there are others that have become favorites to dance to like Butterfly (a fast remix), Spin Spin Sugar (in which the arrows get you to turn around, which is fun!), Block Rockin' Beats, Get Busy (Shake That Thing), La Copa de la Vida (a great salsa-y track that gets me shimmying along), Pump Up the Volume, I Will Survive, Play that Funky Music, and Boom Boom Dollar.<br /><br />There is a huge selection of background dancers to choose from (which I don't use, as the dancers don't really dance along with the music or keep to the beat - I prefer to just see the background animations on their own), and loads of videos.<br /><br />The one thing I dislike about this game is that you have to play their rigidly-structured \"game\" in order to unlock songs, where you have to start dancing on a super-easy mode and pass lots of songs, while the songs you are given get harder and harder. There are some levels that have songs where the arrows come from the wrong direction or you have to hit the dance pad as many times as possible *without* hitting any arrows. This wasn't fun to me; I really wish I could have just unlocked all the songs and special additions by playing the normal old way - selecting my own level and passing new songs. It would have been fun as an additional option but I didn't care for being forced to play it to unlock all the songs.<br /><br />Even with this complaint, this title is well worth adding to your DDR collection.

You can get points to purchase new songs from playing the normal way, but you unlock songs to purchase by playing the Stellar Master Mode, which features all sorts of odd challenges, like strange arrows or arrows that move in odd ways. I play DDR by freshening up my instinct and so retraining my instinct to follow odd arrows is not any fun for me.<br /><br />Then a lot of the songs are a bit too easy for me. I am not a great player by any means, so when I can get an A on Heavy (or Expert as they call it now) Girls Just Wanna Have Fun on my first try it is a bit disappointing. I'd like to have something to work towards!<br /><br />Still, if you are a fan of the series this will give you some fun new songs to play!

They were complicated enough to hold my interest, but I don't feel at all challenged here.<br />Only about half as many songs as a normal DDR game, graphics are clunky<br />The dancers, as always in DDR (I just turn them off)<br /><br />For the price I found it a worthy buy - as a regular player I get bored of the same songs all the time, and so any new game that helps me mix up my workout is much appreciated. But it certainly isn't up to par with the other DDR games, much as I am enjoying playing it.<br /><br />However, I could see new DDR players really enjoying this, because the music is catchy and accessible and the steps aren't too hard.<br /><br />If you are a regular player, know that this is a fun diversion that you will enjoy for a good while, but isn't going to become your challenging new favorite.",

The last few games before this one required you to go through some kind of stupid dance master mode or something to unlock songs- so I was thrilled to find that you can unlock songs, dancers, etc just by playing normally in game mode.<br /><br />Two annoying things in this one:<br /><br />You can't shut off the dancers<br /><br />The announcer is dire - really, really bad. Luckily you can shut him up in options.<br /><br />I do love that there is at least one good rap song in here, and quite a few oldies like Dub-i-Dub and Butterfly (a new remix). There's also just generally a good variety of songs. There's an interesting clubhouse reggae song that I was particularly happy to see.<br /><br />I have played four nights now with a person with very different musical taste than I have, and we both enjoyed it a lot and found songs we wanted to replay each night.<br /><br />I'm giving it five stars because of the simplified unlock process and the fun variety of songs.

I love the soundtrack and often when I don't even feel like playing, I'll play just so I can listen to the tunes.

                "text": "I'm a big fan of the Just Dance line of games, because I love getting exercise while playing. So I was excited to test out this version for kids, especially since I have a little one who will hopefully be able to play with me in a few years, and a niece who is just the right age right now.<br /><br />What I loved about this is that unlike in other games in this line, the dancers on the screen are actual kids! Usually, we get some weird cartoon character with improbable fashion choices, and when I see them moving on the screen I think to myself, &#34;of course you can do that move, you're not a person.&#34; In this game, you get to watch actual kids of different ages doing the dances, sometimes they are dressed up in silly costumes, and sometimes dressed to fit in with the theme of the video. Watching real people do the dance moves increased my enjoyment of the games dramatically, and I wish they had that option for all of the grown-up games.<br /><br />The song list is fantastic for kids, and my niece was familiar with most of the songs. There were also a lot of old-fashioned favorites that I was familiar with, so we had fun together. However, most of the songs have that overly cheerful tone of most children's media, and after about a half hour, I realized that I would never voluntarily choose to play these songs over any of the songs in the grown-up games. Of course, I'm an adult, so that's to be expected, but you should be aware if you are an adult wanting to play this game, you will probably not find the song choices ones that have a lot of intergenerational appeal after the first few plays.<br /><br />That said, they are great picks for kids, and the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. I'd say if your kids are young enough that you do not want them exposed to songs such as &#34;promiscuous girl&#34; which is an example from another Just Dance game, I would definitely choose this game. If you are comfortable with the content of the other games, I would definitely choose those, because the songs are more complex and interesting.",

I loved that mouse, but it died on me after a few months of use. It could be taken apart and adjusted to all sorts of configurations, but one I found the one I liked, I never adjusted it again.<br /><br />This YCCTEAM mouse looks nearly identical, but is one fifth the price. As much work as they put into making it look identical, the hardware is not adjustable, though it does come with a full set of spare feet. The only thing I would change though is the length. It feels a bit short in large hands. It has a pleasant weight to it and feels durable. There are buttons all over it, but I don't tend to hit them by accident and the defaults are all decent.<br /><br />Overall, I feel like this is a really good mouse for the price.",

                "text": "The Rat 6 mouse seems to be going for the customization market, but where it really excels is in simple build quality. The weight, smooth precision parts, and mechanical functioning of this mouse make it fell less like a peripheral and more like a piece of tactical combat gear. The buttons are well placed, it slides smoothly without catching, and the sensor does its job very well.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite feature on the Rat 7 is the small rocker switch behind the scroll wheel which can be used to raise and lower the mouse sensitivity (pointer speed) on the fly, which nearly makes the precision aim button obsolete. These aren't uncommon features on a gaming mouse these days, but they're implemented well.<br /><br />I'm used to using an ambidextrous mouse and switching hands often. This mouse can be used left handed without much difficulty, but you lose access to some of the buttons and features when doing so, most notably the horizontal scroll.<br /><br />I previously owned a RAT 7 and really loved it, but after a couple years it failed on me. First thing to go was the braided cable, which started to short out when parts of it were moved. I hate braided cable. Eventually, I dropped it and was surprised to find one of the buttons had broken from a short fall. In the end, if you use your mouse frequently, it's worth getting a nice one, but the really high priced ones probably aren't worth the premium.<br /><br />Overall, more than worth the price difference between it and the lesser mice on the market.",

I've got much smaller mice that feel more natural in a large hand, but it' not bad if you don't mind a couple fingers dragging on the table. The side buttons are especially well placed.

Like other sim-type games, you are able to customize environments and clothing of some characters and have the freedom to explore and interact, but the similarities mostly end there. You do not control all of the characters/are not able to switch control from one character to another, and there is some linear flow to the action. You are given a series of missions on each of a few locales; as you progress, you are allowed to explore new locales, as well as accumulate options from all current and previous locations.<br /><br />The basic idea is to rebuild and fix different places and help the residents in each one. Sometimes that means finding objects, other times, talking with people to resolve conflicts. To build structures or machines, etc., you need to have certain points which can be found by toying with trees, plants, and other objects. You also need raw materials that are sometimes hidden, or other times uncovered by mining (you have to find hot spots and then use the controller like a little pick axe) or digging, as though for buried treasure.<br /><br />Sometimes it is a little repetitive, but that is the nature of the genre, and all in all, the loose structure and dialogue keep things moving. It would probably be more entertaining if the characters spoke a real language,  but apparently the makers wanted to save on having to do multiple voice-overs and translations, so that's a bit of a loss there, especially for some younger kids, but having dialogue is still appreciated. Also, having to figure out mechanical puzzles might be trickier for the younger crowd, it's fun having to use a little spatial reality logic to make things work, though it's not Very challenging.<br /><br />Wii is definitely improving its offerings, and while this isn't the best game I've seen on the system, the charmingly rendered environment and cute characters and story make this a fun little adventure.",

My faith in it is harmed a bit by the pitiful carabiner included. It would definitely be a bad idea to use that to attach the case to something for the sake of carrying the case. It might be safe to attach something very small to the case for decorative proposes, but if you value whatever the item is don't attach it to the carabiner. Has slots to hold 10 cartridges and a pocket that word be good for manuals. Don't expect it to hold much more. The picture shows it holding the charger, seems to me that putting anything like that is just begging to have broken thumb sticks. The handle feels very sturdy and well attached.",

For the most part, it delivered fast response. As with any change to what a gamer uses, it takes a bit to get used to different placements of controls. According to my son, the software is no comparison to the normal Logitech but for a novice , this would be great. So for gifting, I would recommend thus to a young gamer just starting out and more experienced gamers , this would be 50/50 depending on their needs and likes.",

                "text": "Fable 2 is a great game and I'm glad I purchased it.  To any of you who are on the fence regarding this game, here are a few points to help you make your decision:<br />1) I experienced zero glitches.  I think patches have been loaded because I have played for 2 months and never had a problem.<br /><br />2) As the title of my review states, the \"world\" is smaller.  You don't really travel the roads from one town to another, you just \"fast travel\" there instead.  Actually, I liked this feature because it saves time and just gets to the good stuff.<br /><br />3) I really enjoyed that you don't have to rely on finding money or merchandise to sell in order to get gold for the items you need.  Various jobs are available so you can control how much money you make.  This is especially great at the beginning of the game.<br /><br />4) It's definitely a shorter game than Oblivion, I think I logged only half as many hours in Fable 2 compared to when I beat Oblivion.  What I like about this is that the ending leaves you three different options.  I don't feel like \"Oh, that'll take forever I can't start all over.\"  I have already begun another game with a different character and am enjoying making different decisions this time around.<br /><br />Overall, the game is definitely worth your money and I recommend it highly.  I can understand other reviewers giving it low marks for lack of depth and that they beat it very quickly...but take your time and complete all the quests and enjoy the game and it won't go by too fast.  The review that cracks me up is the one where someone gave it one star because they had a lo-def TV and couldn't read the text!  Wow.  How about giving your TV a one star review?  The game is great!",

                "text": "Overall the game is fun, realistic, and engaging.  I really appreciated not having to learn a new button sequence as they kept everything the same as COD.  Therefore, there's really no adjustment period to get used to the controls.  The first thing I usually do when I rent a game is play through the campaign on Normal.  I enjoy playing on Hard difficulty, too, but usually save that for games I purchase.  I was done with the Normal campaign in about 6 hours.  It was certainly the shortest game I have played, and I found myself wishing it was longer.<br /><br />However, similar to COD, they do a nice job mixing things up so that you have a chance to use many different guns and vehicles throughout the game.  Combat is great - the first time I shotgunned a guy in the head...HOLY cow.  Anyway, I think it's definitely one to put on your \"rent list\" and then see what you think.  Luckily, I didn't purchase this game right away since COD was coming out in early Nov.  I would have seriously wanted my $60 back.",

The cushioning makes a difference and wasn't too hot , tight or heavy. Similarly the ear cuffs are light. They effectively block outsides sounds and the overall sound quality is good. The controls on the cps are easy to use. I liked that the mic was detachable. Although I have been pleased with its performance on non-gaming application, I prefer a less intrusive clip on mic.

The controls are on the earpiece and it takes time to get accustomed to them. Overall it looks cool and performs decently.",

CUE software constantly forgets my button remappings (STILL!!). Super frustrating, I really regret this purchase. I really can't believe how bad iCUE is.<br /><br />Let me preface this by saying if you happen to have long nails you might not like it as much. My thumb nail constantly gets caught on the plate above the side buttons. I need to have it centered because my hands aren't too small and it becomes a bit irritating having it constantly move.<br /><br />Mouse feels fantastic; the build quality is amazing. I expected it to be heavier and larger than it was. It's actually pretty lightweight and on the smaller side compared to my Steel Series Sensei 310. It works amazingly on my mousepad as well (both sides). I think there's an issue with the surface calibration because sometimes my cursor just shoots off into a random direction. Not so ideal for something like an FPS or MOBA where you need precision with your clicks and aim.<br /><br />Once I got the CUE software to FINALLY register my keybindings and remapping (about an hours' work) I fell in love with it. I'm super excited to start using this for FF14!<br /><br />CUE software is definitely a huge downside to this mouse. I wish I had gotten the Razer Naga Trinity instead if I knew this would be just as bad as their Synapse software.",

The  right angle C is great, I love right angle cables because what I have noticed is that there is less tear and fraying accidentally because the actual cable is never having to manually be bent for accommodating odd angles.  The length of this cable makes it great for the added PC gamin experience with your VR because you are able to set good boundaries to prevent accidents.  It's not bulky and thick like some of the others I have seen so the thin sheath is great for protection, but not obstructive.  Most other cables that are similar are ridiculously priced and when I saw this one pop up, I figured it was worth a shot especially at this price point (less than half the cost of most others).  So far, it's been fantastic and if we need more just like it, this will be the one we get again.  Hope this review is helpful!",

Having said that, or keeping that in mind, this one is really spot-on.  It does a really good job at eliminating the facial overheat that you get from the stock headset that comes with your Oculus.  It works well enough that you will notice a huge difference and you won't be able to go back to using the regular headset.  There will still be sweat obviously, because those more intensively active games are going to bring the workout with them, but with the combination of the fan and the cotton interface that helps absorb the sweat, it definitely makes it more user friendly without a doubt.  For the price, this is a great deal and definitely one of those accessories that is absolutely worth getting.  The comfort is important too, and you are not sacrificing any comfort with this fan cover head strap.  Also, this would make a great giftable accessory for someone you know who really loves playing their Oculus and doesn't have a face fan yet.  I would absolutely buy this again if I need another one.

Obviously if you already own an Oculus, then you know how quick the standard, on-board battery can get used up quickly and when you are really into a game, that low battery coming on at the most inconvenient time is frustrating.  So we grabbed this battery strap/pack in hopes that at least it would extend game play by at least half of what they say it will.  Please keep in mind, the charge your Oculus keeps, and the charge the battery pack keeps will greatly depending on how involved the games are that you are playing, but having said that, this battery pack has lived up to what the company states it will.  Usually, it does extend the game ply by 4 hours, I don't keep super tabs on that because we put everything back on the charger when it's not in use, plus no one in this house plays the Oculus for that long at one time, and generally speaking only 2 people play the Oculus back to back,  but from what we can tell, it keeps game play going for an extended 4 hrs at least.  The strap is extremely comfortable and easy to set up.  This would also be a great accessory to give as a gift to the other people you know who own an Oculus.  Absolute five-star review that is well deserved.  I hope this review is helpful!",

The sound quality is fantastic though and the noise cancelling might work a bit too well.  They are very comfortable on my head and ears, not too light and not too heavy.  They are made of quality material and I am just overall super pleased with this set so far.  The RGB works great too, matches all of my other RGB gear.

This will be a subjective way of playing that game because you will run across people who prefer to use the stick controllers over the individual handles and vice-versa, but me personally, I could play either way and depending on the song, I often do better on some of the faster songs with the stick versus the individual handles.

                "text": "I've just started playing hidden object adventure games, and this is by far the best.  The graphics are very good, the music is moody, and there is lots to do.  Most hidden object games make you find meaningless objects over and over in scene after scene that all look relatively the same.  Not Dreamland.  Each hidden object scene is very unique in appearance, and makes sense in the theme of the place.  And the puzzles far outnumber the hidden object searches, which in my book is great.  It took me almost 6 hours to finish this game, and that's much longer than most I have played.  Very unique in concept, design, and execution.",

Second of all, no tasks that didn't have some purpose to further the storyline.  My only complaint was that there were some pretty obvious pieces missing from the story at the beginning that would have made the ending much more logical.  But all in all, a very nice game.  The cut scenes were a bit &#34;plastic&#34; looking, but the game art was top notch.  No puzzles were too hard, and you could skip any of them.  Good game overall.",

                "text": "Original Review:<br />Beautiful graphics, quirky gameplay.  I'd have loved this game, but I came to a mini-game towards the end of the game that requires you to shoot 33 enemies without getting shot once.  This is NOT why I play adventure type games.  And there is no way to skip it, so I was deprived of the joy of finishing this lovely game.<br /><br />Edited Review:<br />I am editing this after completing the game.  I was too thick to realize that there was a way to replenish my \"lives\" in the mini-game I mentioned in my original review.  Once I figured that out, I was able to complete the mini-game pretty easily.<br /><br />In closing, I have to explain that I used to play this type of game all the time back in the heyday of \"real\" adventure games (like Myst).  And back then, there wasn't always a walkthrough - you just puzzled it out until you figured it out.  And that was half the fun.  How lazy I've become!  What's left of the adventure genre of games is way easier, and you can almost always skip the mini-games.  So this game was very hard for me.  I couldn't have finished it without a walkthrough, but that's just proof that I have become spoiled and lazy!<br /><br />All in all, this is a beautiful game, beautifully designed, illustrated, and executed.  They just don't make games like this anymore.  If you are a fan of the old-fashioned adventure game, and particularly one with no violence (unless you count shooting at tiny red pixel bad-guys with a tiny blue pixel gun), and if you love the artwork and design in your games as much as the games themselves, Machinarium is the game for you.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 star rating is that it would have been nice to provide a \"skip\" feature, for those that just didn't want to kill themselves with a mini-game they didn't like and couldn't solve.",

The storyline flowed very well, and the length of the game was good too.  I can't say enough about the graphics - this game is extremely artistic.  Even the HOG scenes were well thought out, with quite a few objects that had to be pieced together, or the need to find objects inside other objects (like chests, drawers, even paintings).  I even loved the music!  All in all, this game was quality throughout, well thought out, and enjoyable.  Well worth the price.",

Choosing your path is a bit too straight forward it seems, but all and all it is a fun game. Once you have beaten it about 3 times you are ready to retire it for a LONG time. After a year or two you may go back to it again, only to realize it's shear simplicity. That said, once I was able to play the game smoothly the first few times, it was pretty epic considering when it came out and all. Comparing it to games today it still gets a fairly decent score in the fun department. I would still give it 7/10 for the fun and back then a 9/10. So why the one star? Well because I was refering more to being able to play the Xbox version, this PC version was never able to launch and so if the game can't be played how can it be any good?",

                "text": "Ok let me start by saying that this game is really fun but it does have some fatal flaws that you should look at before buying it.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />-Good Campaign Story<br />-Brought Back and Revolutionized Zombies<br />-A lot of Extra Map Packs for Purchase<br />-A new and better lvling system in multiplayer<br />-A wide Range of Gun selection<br />-No more Noob-Tubing<br />-You can now Purchase your guns with money you earn rather than break your back with stupid achievements.<br />-You can Make your own Emblem<br />-Way better Killstreaks<br />-Improved Graphics<br />-Overall Very Fun!<br /><br />The Cons:<br />-Campaign Gameplay is rather bland<br />-You'll lose connection to the game host more often<br />-Some Guns are not Accurately portrayed (Some Guns like M16 are 3 round bursts only and FAMAS is full auto only, also the AK47 is weaker than the M16?)<br />-They got rid of the SCAR<br /><br />Overall you can plainly see that the Pros really outweigh the cons by A LOT! They have a storyline their just because but this really is a game that was made to shine for multiplayer and in fact in many ways I think it's much better than MW3 and MW2 and is a much more balanced and realistic gameplay. You get most of the most reputable guns of the cold war and even some rarely seen and unique ones! This is definatley a game your gonna want to pick up and try. The main reason I think people are dissapointed in this game is the same reason for most games/movies of this league.....OVER HYPE! Some people who gave this game a horrid rating do not have an open mind either to this style of gameplay or the reality of the design of this game. Is this game for everyone? No. But if you like fast paced action/first person shooters and like to interact with others than I highly urge you to give this game a go! Please note that if you do not have internet set up or dont like multiplayer games that you will HATE this game because it all revolves around human interaction for it's fun. If you like going solo go for Call of Duty 1,2,3, and World at War and maybe Call of Duty 4. And yes SCAR lovers I do feel your pain too. But try to lighten up, their are a ton of good guns that can take the place of your SCAR for at least one Call of Duty game.",

Make sure you only play this game when you have plenty of free time. While  you may not have a huge area to explore they do improve your options from Sims 2. You can play Arcades, use computers and such  to find jobs, chat with other sims, or go to the boardwalk and learn to play the guitar. Also having pets is a bonus if you want them, but you don't have to have  them either which is cool as I didn't really want any. You can choose where you  want to  live. You can also build and customize like all the Sims which is freaking awesome. Overall its pretty darn fun on long road trips or just relaxing in the bedroom and play. This game can be fun for all ages so long as children can read and understand financial stuff like your mortgage or rent. I really like this game even though it doesn't compare to the PC/Console versions. That said I give it a 4 star rating just because it has some shortcomings. Its not quit as fun as the Xbox or PC version, but  all that  said, sometimes I am not in the Mood to play Lego, Mario, or Pokémon games. In  those cases this game is very addictive. You can spend upward of 3 or even 4 hours playing in some cases. Hope this review helps somebody out.",

                "text": "This game is NOT very good. It does NOT live up to the old RTW at all. Empires Total War is better than this garbage and that says a lot! First off the Unit/Building cards are freaking ugly. They confuse you. Its hard to identify units unless you put your cursor over each one so it can tell you what they are. Its horrid! Also I was lead to believe the settlements were or could grow to be huge. But after several siege battles they  look nothing like the Siege of Carthage trailer portrays it to look like. Also no cut scenes for each faction before playing  to set you in the mood and not General's speeches just really saddened me. I always looked  forward to them. Options for this  game are very limited. I liked the other games more, as they gave you more options in the way you  could expand. Instead this  game gives you strict guidelines and  the diplomacy is  STILL broken. The AI ALWAYS tries to screw you and sometimes its impossible to even get trade rights (which is crazy). After conquering the British Isles I got  bored to  tears. The whole thing is  SOOOO slow. The wait time in between turns are also insanely long. Look, I own ALL the Total War  titles and I can say this  was the worst and the biggest let down. I can't say I hate it. But I wont be playing it much. Absolutely NOT WORTH THE $60 they want for it. Its corny as hell. Maybe I wouldn't be so mad if it were a $20 game. But  it  is just  not worth  the  money or hassle at the time. Check back when  a Darthmod is released. till then have fun with the other titles in the series.",

                "text": "This game is extremely fun and addictive. I have played and beat all 3 campaigns which were all awesome and sometimes creepy. As a marine you have got to stay on your toes, never know when those damn Aliens or Facehuggers can pop out at you. You get a 18 round Semi auto pistol to start off with which can be a decent weapon when low on ammo but not accurate at longer ranges (as one can expect from handguns). The pulse rifle is straight from the movies and is the same model of rifle as was seen in the original Alien movie and follow up in the Prequel Aliens. This bad boy can hold 99 in each mag and is a straight shooter but be careful its rate of fire can get you into trouble if you don't stay on target. Shotgun! Love the double barrel shotgun in this game, get those pesky face huggers away from you and headshot a Alien, that will learn em! So you are surrounded by a bunch of eggs? HELLO FALMETHROWER! If you like the smartgun you will see it later on in game and it can be a life saver from the hordes! Also some decent character interaction all be it very short and brief in lvls.<br /><br />Predators: You recall the first AVP movie? Ya boy, you are gonna get all those weapons my friend! The smart disc is probably my favorite weapon. Its a non lock on disc that you can throw and it will follow your laser! Get good with that and you can drop 2 or 3 aliens in one swing! Of course you will also  get those huge wrist blades as well which are good for melee offense and defense. As a Predator you will also get the notorious lock on Plasma Cannon that we have all come to love! But you have limited uses so make shots count and be a true hunter. You will get 3 types of vision. Regular, Thermal (as seen in Predator 1 and 2 and AVP), and also a special vision to detect those Xenos. All said this was actually my least favorite campaign for some odd reason. Its all personal preference but it was still good fun!<br /><br />Aliens: The Aliens campaign might just be my favorite with the marines a very close second. I must admit I enjoyed the creep factor and darkness of the Marine campaign a lot. But as an Alien you become a profession hunter of the dark. You can stalk and lure your prey towards you and sprint so fast they wont know what hit them. Also when you sprint you are neigh impossible to shoot when running away. Sometimes I just like teasing the Marines for a while and toy with them before killing them. BE WARNED, Aliens are probably the weakest as far as defense goes. If those Marines are packing shotguns you better have a plan. You can climb on walls ceilings, roof tops....pretty much everything, no wait scratch that you can climb on EVERYTHING. I love it! Stealth kills truly are fun! Ripping off faces, shoving that wicked tongue clamper into heads, impaling with your tail...just awesome!<br /><br />Graphics: are pretty good in my book. They are not the best but far from the worst! I give the graphics an 8/10<br />Sound: excellent! truly the original sounds from the movies and creepy as hell at times! Keeps you on your toes. 10/10<br />Gameplay: Gameplay was excellent in my book. Tons of fun and challenging, super intense. Action packed but also as a Pred or Alien you needed strategy. But sometimes as an alien you could mess up on kills because of how they cling on to things. It takes a while to get used to. And I wasnt a fan of how the Preds left stealth after using certain attacks or weapons. Gameplay as a Marine was everything I could have asked for. Major creep factor to keep you on your toes, excellent action, and all the essential weapons as well from the movies. Overall the gameplay gets a 9/10.<br />Multiplayer: Is fun but sadly you don't see a lot of team work. I personally suck and I wont lie about it but it is still pretty fun. 8/10<br />Cons: This game was really short! While the lvls were decent in length you only get 5-7 lvls per campaign with the Marines having the longest campaign. I really wished we could have had more content and lvls in campaign. I killed the Predator and Alien campaigns in one sitting and wrapped things up with the Marines the very next morning.<br /><br />VERDICT: 8.5 is my overall score for this game. I really think its awesome, challenging, action packed, creepy, and extremely fun. The multiplayer is fun but it does take time to get used to. The only real problem is the campaigns are too short. To remedy this I recommend trying it on hard mode. It will keep you playing much longer than easy or normal modes.",

If you're a MJ fan, then this is the perfect game for you.  I danced, I sang, then I danced some more.  Interesting enough it wasn't hard to follow the moves from the pictograms or even MJ himself because they depicted his signature moves.  I'm totally in love with this game.<br /><br />Now for the bad... unlocking training videos, really?  Training and warm/up videos should have been a feature that is available to the user before they begin attempting the dance moves and not something that the user gets after he has attempted the dance moves.  The next thing that I found annoying was that I had to enter my name each time I completed a song.  I should have been assigned a avatar/user at the beginning of the game to eliminate this need.<br /><br />Overall, BIG FUN!!!  But, I couldn't in good conscience give this game the full five stars because of the problems with game usability.  The realism and fun of the songs and dance moves are a solid 6 stars but the usability is a only worthy of 2 stars.  Thus, I'll compromise with a rating of 4 stars.",

I've used a multitude of comparable headsets over the years, SteelSeries, Logitechs, Turtle Beaches, Razers, pretty much anything I could get my hands on for under $200.

I lost a lot of family members earlier in life too, and responded in a somewhat similar way as she did. I'll always love Chuunibyou, and as such, Rikka. So, that brings us to the product in question. The build and art quality are both phenomenal. It's certainly sturdy, feels like nothing would happen if there were to be an accident involving a shelf, an elbow, some force, and a fall to the ground. While I read the dimensions, it still seemed a little tall to me while I took it out the box, which is really nice. Definitely recommend Sega products, I have a few more on the way, and already received two, the other being Chino from Is The Order A Rabbit?",

If you play an MMORPG that uses a 1-12 action bar, you will have to change the 11 and 12 buttons in the game to use - and + as their key bindings.  Also, most gaming mice call their extra buttons (the ones an the top)  M4, and M5 and you can just click them into a games interface to bind them.  This mouse requires you to name a function for the buttons  in it's own software.<br /><br />Something that I didn't like about this mouse is that the lighting is changeable on the buttons, but the mouse wheel always glows yellow.  It's an eyesore.<br /><br />One thing that I really like is the multiple profiles that are switchable on the fly.
