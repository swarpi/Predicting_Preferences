This mask is the best for hydration. It can be used by all skin types. The sheet is soft and flexible. You can stretch it as needed. I always stretch the eye holes since I have larger eyes. It also prevents the serum from dripping in your eyes. Another tip is to rub the mask on the backs of your hands before throwing it away. That skin needs special care also. The best part about this set is that you get so many masks. You can try using one nightly to see how it changes your skin. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.",

I find that this has light natural coverage using a foundation brush. It tones down my redness with ease. It can be built up, especially if allowed to semi dry between applications. I really like that it has SPF (PA++++) 50. I always use sunscreen, so adding this on top of my sunscreen base is just added protection. Also perfect for reapplication & touch ups through day.<br /><br />I also find that it is hydrating on my dry skin. Has a dewy finish. My natural skin comes through but looks better- more spruced up and put together looking. I do notice that the finish depends on what I use before hand. When I have used this on bare skin, it has a more mattifying appearance. When I use on top of my moisturizer and/or moisturizing sunscreen, then it has a more dewy radiant look. I prefer the latter.<br /><br />Seems to stay in place. I applied some to my forearm, and it is still in place a couple hours later. I have taken my finger to try to wipe it off, and it is still there.<br /><br />4 stars. I prefer it for light coverage. When it is built up, it seems to take on a grayish cast on me.",

                "text": "I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.  Keep in mind, I have very little hair and it is very very fine.  This curling iron really make my hair look amazing.",

Maybe that's just me 🤔 Regardless, I feel the shade is very pretty...and definitely is metallic.<br /><br />It's also very long-lasting- to the point that later when taking it off, I used both an oil cleanser and makeup remover. Transferring is minimal. It actually stays a little sticky the whole time while wearing it, so that makes it a little surprising that it's so long lasting- since many liquids dry completely. It's not overly sticky, so I didn't find it bothersome.<br /><br />Applies smoothly- it does feel like a velvety, whipped texture<br /><br />If you're concerned about the appearance of lines on your lips with a liquid lipstick- I feel this is one makes them a bit pronounced.<br /><br />Overall, for a liquid lipstick, I think it's pretty good. Has rich pigment and has a stand-out metallic look<br /><br />Packaging is pretty",

The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />\"You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.\"<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set. He's still talking about it so he did like it, just thought it was a bit much.",

I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower. A couple days later my right foot started to peel first but got really itchy so i think i scratched off some of the peeling skin. The description says it will peel in about a week and leave skin smooth but my whole foot didnt peel and I still have patches of dried skin and calluses.

They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. Once I spray it on a few times over an hour or so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put my nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe, as it is quite strong at first. But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived. This is also very expensive \"Cologne\" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it.  <br />For others this \"Baby Cologne\" may be something wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can. As I said, I really love the idea of a light fragrance, but not for babies. I do wish the scent stuck around more for me.",

My husband also said he really liked it, so that's a win! The only thing I don't love about it is the cheap looking plastic lid on the bottle. It really cheapens the look of the bottle and doesn't snap on well, which is kind of a pain. I thought about just throwing it away, but then if I travel with the bottle I'm afraid it will spray all over my bag. Other than that, I'm a huge fan of this scent and would order this again in a heartbeat. I can't believe that a fragrance that smells this good, in a bottle and package that looks this great is so reasonably priced.",

At this point, make sure to detangle the hair well and section it into smaller parts so that you can apply the keratin treatment. The hair should be 80% towel dried. You then comb in the keratin treatment to each section of hair. I recommend wearing gloves. Allow it time to process and then blow dry and finish with a flat iron. The hair came out quite silky and smooth, but it began to revert into fluffiness as the day went on. Adding a bit of hair oil helped to restrain the humidity.

The cream itself is very sheer and feels lovely going on. It's absorbed quickly and leaves no greasy residue behind. My skin is quite sensitive and I've experienced no breakout issues.

It comes with a double mirrored compact, a cute dish that can be used to hold rings and jewelry - or even soap, and a cosmetic bag. This is very giftable. My only critique  is that the cosmetic bag feels cheaply made. I still think this is a great gift for young girls or teenagers, but just know that the cosmetic bag may not be super long lasting. I love the message and think this would be very inspiring and encouraging to anyone using it!  See my pictures for details. Thank you for reading my review.",

                "text": "JUNGSAEMMOOL Minifying Cica Mist Balm is a moisturizing balm for sensitive skin that soothes irritation and helps redness. It’s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I’m unable to find a full ingredient list. The box has directions in English but lacks an ingredient list in English, so I don’t know what’s even in this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and avoid many skincare ingredients, so I won’t make this balm or any product part of my daily routine without an ingredient list.<br /><br />I have used this balm a few times after my moisturizer and before foundation (if wearing makeup). The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. But it’s less than I get with my corrective color makeup. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I’d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. But I can’t judge if the trade off is there without knowing ingredients.<br /><br />This balm also makes my skin smoother. It feels like it might have silicone and/or glycerin and feels a lot like a primer under my makeup. I like the moist and spreadable texture, except it’s so soft I can’t just swipe across the top with the puff for an even amount of product as it smooshes in the balm and gouges out pieces (which I then spread and dab with the puff). It becomes less noticeable as the balm soaks in, but I don’t like that this settles into and emphasizes pores on my nose. This is just okay for me. 3 stars. Made in Korea.",

I would say quality falls into the average lane.  Some of them have more glue visible than others but overall they’ve been done well enough. The key for the area that goes behind the ears is to position it so it’s not directly on the skin but more on hair.

                "text": "I was curious about a perfume for baby because we've been taught not to use anything on the little ones except the gentlest of lotions and body wash. I decided to give this a try because I was curious about the scent and the execution of a product like this.<br /><br />First thing I did was smell this, and while it is a pleasant smell, this particular scent isn't my favorite. It is too floral for me, almost artificial. I may have liked and felt more comfortable using a citrus and fruity type of scent on my little one. I also looked at the ingredients list and while they may be free of parabens, phthalates, synthetic colors, dyes, GMOs, and Gluten Free, there are some potentially irritating ingredients for the very sensitive of skins. Ingredients like Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene can be an allergen. It may have prebiotics which is good but one good ingredient does not negate a potentially irritating one. I'm all for someone coming up with a safe and good cologne for baby but I'm not entirely sold on this product just yet. I did read up on some additional information but I need more convincing for me to be on board with this perfume for infants. I do love the story of why the founder wanted to create these scents for little ones but I'm just not fully on board with some of the ingredients used.<br /><br />I'm not sure I will be using this on my baby but I think a more appropriate age is pre-teen or teens. I may have been a little more open to a \"cleaner\" perfume for that age range as I'm sure there's a market for that. From what I read, the founder is going to be launching perfumes for that age group, so that might be more appropriate.<br /><br />My baby actually smells nice from good hygiene so he doesn't need anything else but I understand the concept behind these scents. Fragrances do invoke certain memories, just like music. There are certain scents that I get a whiff of and it immediately transports me back to that day, the person, or the memories of that particular time period. All that said, I will be holding off using perfume on my baby and will be spritzing this stuff on myself. I think the concept is great but I would like to see even \"better\" and cleaner ingredients if I am to use it on my baby.<br /><br />I didn't see the ingredients list posted on this Amazon page yet so here it is:<br />Ingredients:<br />Alcohol Denat., Aqua (Water), Parfum (Fragrance) Niacinamide, Glycerin, Lactitol, Xylitol, Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Gernaniol, Amyl Cinnamal, Limolene, Hydroxycitronellal.",

I wasn't sure what I would think about their actual lipsticks however because of the bullet style is so unusual, but I really love this. The formula is creamy but long-lasting and even leaves a little bit of a stain, and the color is just the perfect red in my opinion it's a slightly deeper red so it feels a little more sophisticated and a little more wearable than a brighter red. It also has a slight blue base to it which makes your teeth look a little wider. The packaging is absolutely lovely and I actually find that I really enjoy the style of the lipstick bullet. I still always wear a lip liner of course but the angle of this makes it really easy to fully coat your lips. I will absolutely be buying more lipsticks from this brand.",

My experience – especially with most beauty products – is that if they are Vegan they definitely like to tout it on the product.  I am going to assume it is – but it should still say it clearly on it...<br /><br />It is black – so it is definitely “a look” for most people.  If you are goth or something – you will probably love it.  I got it mostly for Halloween.  Especially as it is matte – I can use it on my face as a whole to help with my costume– and not just on my lips.  It is easy to apply and actually applied VERY precisely.  If you wear it alone it is sort of dry on the lips – but not as dry as some others out there.  I like to add a slight layer of a balm first – just to give me some hydration.  It still comes off very matte that way but maybe doesn’t wear as well for longevity.  Even then – it didn’t come off on my teeth – just slightly on a cup I was drinking out of.  Not terrible at all though.  It has a slightly vanilla like scent to it.  It is pretty nice.  It sort of stayed put but was also easy enough to wipe off with a paper towel and some pressure.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )",

                "text": "PeriPera is kinda known for having amazing lip tints & stains. When I saw that they were offering lipstick bullets now, I thought these would have that same effect. I was mistaken. This is a soft textured matte lip cream developed to attain the look of blurred lips, a popular Korean beauty trend. What exactly does \"blurred lips\" translate to in the West? It means skip the harsh lip liner & soften the edges of your lip borders. The goal is to achieve a gradual gradient of color.<br /><br />I got shade n°8 \"City Pop Chili\", which I would describe as a burnt brick red color. It feels very Autumnal and will be best complemented by those with warm skintones.<br /><br />The texture of the lip cream itself is soft & smooth, sorta like a mousse. It's very lightweight, easy to blend, and feels comfortable on the lips. It has a matte finish, with just the right amount of moisturizing properties to keep it from completely drying out my lips.<br /><br />I found that it's best to apply this product straight from the tube. I tried to build up opacity by using a lip brush to apply it, but every time I'd swipe the brush across my lips, it would actually remove product and leave bald spots. The formula isn't as long wearing as I was expecting from a matte lipstick, either. After a couple hours of eating, drinking, and expressive mouth movements, the color wears off entirely and I have to reapply. I really wish this wore down to a stain, but that's not what PeriPera was going for.<br /><br />The frosted, translucent pink lipstick component used for this line of lippies is understated, but pretty. It looks very feminine. The actual lipstick bullet has a slim silhouette and an angled tip. You get exactly one inch of visible product inside the tube. This formula is free of fragrance. There is no scent at all that I can detect.<br /><br />Expiration date printed on my product packaging is Aug. 2024<br />(2 years & 10 months from when I purchased it in Oct. 2021)<br /><br />Full Ingredients:<br />Dimethicone, Dibutyl Adipate, Microcrystalline Wax, Polyethylene, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Ceresin, Iron Oxide Red, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Agave Tequilana Leaf Extract, Diglyceryl Sebacate/Isopalmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Silica, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Butylene Glycol, Water, BHT, Fragrance, Lithol Rubine BCA, Sunset Yellow FCF, Brilliant Blue FCF, Tartrazine",

I use it after I cleanse and tone my face, let it fully absorb for a few minutes, and then apply my serums and/or just moisturizer. When I use it at night I find that my skin feels plumper and moisturized when I wake up. The 2oz bottle can stretch out over a long period of time too, so the product is worth the money, it’s just not quite in my everyday price range. I do like that I can cut out serums at night and still feel like I’m treating my face. I don’t have visible wrinkles yet so I haven’t seen any anti-wrinkle effects, but my skin does feel fuller, if that makes sense. My skin feels tighter in a good way, and my skin looks and feels softer and just overall more even looking.",

The ingredients seem relatively standard other than the addition of caffeine.  While I like the roller and packaging and the way this feels when applying, I am not noticing any results.  The serum applies *very* thinly... you can barely tell anything has come out of the roller at all.  Because I didn’t experience any effect I thought that maybe the issue was a lack of serum actually being applied and so I started applying it more frequently, and still no noticeable effect for me.  It does provide some moisturization, without leaving a sheen, but doesn’t work as well as another serum that I have used (which also has a very similar roller type application).  I will continue to use it and maybe the results are just delayed... if so I will update the review.  Hope this is helpful to you...",

I thought the button was just a press and release and the spikes would just keep popping up.  no... u press the button up and it holds it in place while the bristles disappear.  u then move ur finger over the button towards u and the button releases and the bristles pop out again.  I would say that the brush feels quite bulky in my larger girly hand.  my sister was concerned that the button would break over not that much time.  my vote is to use this specifically for a dog and buy a smaller brush with the same concept for a cat.

                "text": "So far, I have no real complaints about this NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum Bundle. I’m still at the point where I’m not sure if I can say it truly works because I need to use it for a longer period of time, but I’ll discuss various aspects about the product that will hopefully help with your decision-making.<br /><br />-Came well-packaged in a small, but sturdy cardboard box. Everything arrived intact. I have continued to use this box for storage of the product.<br />-Comes with the handheld laser device, charger with base to plug into an outlet, and manual<br />-No complaints about the battery life so far<br />-Simple to use: there are two buttons: The power button that turns the device on. Then you can press it to cycle through the various levels of intensity 1-5 which are clearly shown using green light bars. You can then hold the power button down to turn the device off again. The top button can be pressed to activate the laser after you have chosen the level of intensity you want.<br />-The laser only works if positioned correctly over an area of skin. It will give a single negative sounding beep if not positioned correctly, and a positive sounding double beep if it is positioned correctly as the laser works. You wait to move the device to the next area after you hear that second beep indicating that it is finished with that laser sequence<br />-The device has a white, plastic outer shell. It is lightweight while still feeling sturdy and durable. I would still be very careful not to drop this as I’m not sure how it could handle a fall<br />-I would recommend experimenting on the lower intensity settings. The undereye area is pretty sensitive. I feel I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but my eyes often still tear up after using per instructions on the highest settings of 4 and 5. For whatever reason, my left eye is much more sensitive to this.<br />-I don’t want to say it is truly painful, but I suppose the best way to describe the sensation is almost similar to if you were being stung by a rubber band that you pulled back and let hit your skin if that makes sense. It isn’t comfortable, but you do get more used to this and can work your way up to a higher level of intensity. You will probably also feel some warmth on the skin after using.<br />-I know this is marketed for under the eyes, but I have also been using on my forehead and by my smile lines.<br /><br />***The instruction manual is pretty clear and straightforward. You definitely need to read this before getting started. Here is some information that you can find within the manual:<br /><br />-They say all skin tones and anyone over the age of 12 can use NIRA to reduce the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes<br />-You need to clean and dry your face just prior to using NIRA<br />-It can be using morning or night and up to twice daily. They recommend waiting 1 minute before retreating each area and not to treat more than twice within a 1-hour period.<br />-Do not treat the same spot twice in a row, even if the pulse is rejected and you get the low pitched, negative sounding beep<br />-The instructions clearly show you the recommended way to treat the undereye area and the treatment pattern to use<br />-They recommend using the highest power level where you feel warmth without pain<br />-You should use a facial moisturizer after each treatment and a daily sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is recommended. This bundle includes the hyaluronic acid serum which can also be used.<br />-Device should be kept clean and free of dust, especially the glass lens which can be cleaned with a cotton swab. Surfaces can be cleaned with 70% alcohol solution between each use.<br />-They say some potential side effects include: skin warmth, redness, and stinging. Less frequent side effects include dryness, roughness, tanned appearance to skin, swelling, flaking, itching, crusting, bruising, pimple-like rash, irritated skin, blistering, scarring, infection, and skin color changes where your skin may become darker or lighter. I have only experienced the temporary warmth and stinging during use- no redness or anything else.<br />-The company also cautions those who have skin conditions or are undergoing professional cosmetic treatments such as injectable toxins like Botox or fillers- saying to check with your doctor or clinician prior to using NIRA.<br />-Only use on intact skin<br />-Don’t use if pregnant or nursing or undergoing fertility treatments<br />-Do not use if you have a history of skin cancer, any other cancer, or pre-malignant moles<br />-Do not treat if you have tanned skin which is apparently at increased risk of adverse effects with light-based devices<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with how the product functions and the ease of use. I will continue using and will update if I have any further comments or concerns. I haven’t noticed any real results yet, but I also haven’t been using it that long. One question that comes to mind is this: What is the lifespan of this device? Months? Years? Or does it give out after firing the laser a certain number of times? I could have missed it in the manual, but that is something I’m still not sure of. For the current price of $329, that is something I think people may want to know. I haven’t had any issues with the serum that comes in this package, but it seems pretty simple and basic.",

So, already it has a head start.<br />It comes inside a nice, somewhat snug drawstring bag. This is useful for transporting the curling device. And, yes, the compact size makes it very sensible to pack for remote (away from home) usage.  Another key aspect of the product is wireless operation. Evidence: she comments that not having to worry about wires or being close to the wall outlet is fantastic. And, not dealing with power cords means better time efficiency.<br />Operation is fairly easy. A long press of the power button turns it on. When you press the power button again, you advance to a feature you can alter/select, with that aspect blinking. For example, the \"R\" might be blinking. You use the +/- button to change it to \"L\" (R and L indicate the curling direction, creating right or left curls). In this manner, you can change the direction, temperature and timer.  The display also shows the battery power status.  When the curler device has reached proper temperature, it beeps. You can then insert a small section of hair. Curling appearance/tightness will depend on hair texture, temperature and time of treatment.<br />The battery capacity is rated at 5000mAh. It takes 3 - 4 hours to fully charge a depleted battery. This affords 4 - 6 hours of continuous operating time.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the wireless hair curling device, with a ruler for size reference. Close ups of the display, with varying settings, is provided to some of the selection options.<br />The significant other gives it two thumbs up with a smile.  👍👍  😄  Accordingly, it earns a 4.5+ star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",

First, the scent. I get migraines, and scents are a trigger. Citrus, eucalyptus, and peppermint are OK - perfumes or manufactured fragrances have become a big \"no\" for me. Since a side effect is an extra sensitive sense of smell (which means things I put on my face have to be tolerated), I gravitate towards those I can tolerate. Sometimes even scents I usually like go awry in plastic containers or in a specific cosmetic mix. But this citrus is lovely. Limes, oranges, lemons, all rolled into one. A veritable orchard from this single cream. Wonderful.<br /><br />And the cream? So light, silky smooth, and creamy. From trying other creams, I know that if there's any chance the product will be slow to absorb, that will happen with my skin. This cream was quick to absorb, not heavy or weighing down, and left my skin feeling moisturized, refreshed, and as velvety soft as the cream itself.<br /><br />I'm also delighted that this product complies with the Australian SafeCosmetics Toxic Free Campaign and is listed as a participating vendor. Safer for me, safer for the environment in which we live. Great product, one I enjoy using.",

I clip it to the shoulder strap (on my chest) of my backpack so my hand sanitizer is always within reach. However, this type of container isn't well suited for squeezing out gels in small amounts. The bottle is so soft that you have to really be careful with how you squeeze it. It easily splurts out blobs that are too much for just hand sanitizer.  I found these bottles are better used for shampoo, conditioner, body wash where you need much larger volumes squeezed out than you would need for hand sanitizer.",

But lets talk about the packaging and the quantity of the mask it self. The tin came all scratched up and \"worn out\". When I examined it, it looked as if it's old, and sat around for a while. (not a giftable appearance). Quantity and price is a joke. If you refer to my pictures, the small jar is about 30% full. Where is the other 70%? Or at least another 30%?

As with the other Tula products I have tried, this did not disappoint. If I could have rated it higher than 5 stars, I would have. It is a thick luxurious cream that glides on your face like silk and is quickly absorbed. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy or tacky,  just soft, hydrated & moisturized. Today is a non-makeup day for me & I am just going to enjoy the way my face feels after using this awesome cream.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this product when it's out, although you only need a little, so I'm assuming this tub will last a long time.

The dark blue is our favorite color and we love that you can get the deep color with great glitter and shine using just one coat, on top of the base coat.  There are no base or top coats included, but as long as you have them, the set, along with a nail clipper and file is all you need to have salon quality manicure and pedicure.  The magnet included with the kit is rectangular, as shown, and is effective at making long streaks on the nails.  With some practice, you’ll be able to create very defined cat eyes, but make sure you keep the cure lights right nearby, or you’ll lose the streaking.  Additionally, make sure that you buff the nails lightly, clean the nails thoroughly, and run full cure times if you want to have the nail polish last more than two weeks.  Following this simple procedure will hopefully give you a high quality and long lasting finish like I have experienced.  I recommend Pine Gel Nail Polish and am sure you’ll be super happy with the results.",

It is replacing another nice one I have because well, it's a lot cuter for one, and two it looked much more comfortable and less damaging on the delicate front hairs and face.  My other cap fits tight with a very scrunched elastic band that I found kept the water out, but also left the hairs around my hair line kinked and left me with a red line across my forehead that usually wasn't gone by the time I had to run out the door. This one does not! Yay!  It is also silky and kept my hair smooth and dry. Definitely keeping it.",

The description and images leaves the impression that this is a powder product, in reality, the texture is closer to ELF's putty primer. When I applied it to dry bare skin using the puff it pilled slightly, I did get better results blending it with my finger tips. It leaves an overall light green veil of color on bare skin that's not overly noticeable and leaves a matte finish. Don't let the matte finish fool you though, it melts into your skin leaving it moisturized without feeling greasy.<br /><br />My skin is only slightly sensitive and when irritated doesn't react with major noticeable redness or heat. It did calm the redness I sometimes have around my nose and chin.  I've not yet tested this over or under foundation and wonder if it would work well as a primer?

I finish it off with a blow dryer with a diffuser but this gets out all the excess moisture and being able to put it up really keeps it out of my way. It came with a couple of scrunchies as well.

The razor gives a super close shave and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. The only thing that makes me nervous is the handle. It becomes slippery in the shower so I can't get a good grip. It worries me that I will cut myself when I am shaving. I searched if the company sells refill blades for this but they don't have them. You will have to purchase the whole set again, so that is something to think about before purchasing.",

                "text": "I have delicate, acne-prone skin.  Lately, I noticed that the skin on my back was breaking out.  Fortunately, I began using the Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush.  It doesn't have sharp bristles that scratch and irritate my skin.  The brush feels as though it has plush fur from a plush animal.  It is very soft, almost too soft.  It feels great when I use it on the bottoms of my bare feet.  This brush, I believe is for elderly people or those with very sensitive skin.  It has a long, durable string for easy hanging in the bath or shower.<br /><br />Despite it not being very exfoliating, the skin on my lower back has cleared up quite a bit.  I've been using this brush faithfully for two weeks.  It is lightweight, manufactured well, and attractive.  I like the bamboo handle, which is smooth and easy to grip.  It doesn't put splinters into my fingers and palms.  I can use this brush all over my body, but I use it primarily on my back and feet.  It arrived inside its own plastic, transparent box for protection and for easy gift wrapping in case you want to give it to someone as a present.  The box can also be used for storing the brush.<br /><br />The brush's head is very easy to clean after it has been used.  I have used both bar soap and liquid soap on the head.  The brush works well with many types of soap.  When using this brush, I always feel as though I am treating myself to a luxurious bath.  I highly recommend this Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush to anyone who has delicate skin.  If you are looking for a type of brush that will exfoliate your skin (sloughing off all those dead skin cells), then you may want to look for another brush.  For right now, I am very satisfied with the Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush.",

I feel that the box is a nice addition if you plan on giving these as a gift. I think this would make a wonderful gift for a young girl or even an older lady.

Some are perfect, but some are not. The knots were not in the same spots on all of them. Some had knots on the top in the middle and then some of the knots were slightly off to the side. Also the fabric on some are glued on slightly crooked and some are a smaller size then the others.  So a couple of them were too small for my daughters head. Even though some have a few minor issues, she says she still loves the ones I gave her. So I am at least happy about that. She does wear them all the time and they do look flattering on her. The only thing is the flower print ones she has a harder time matching to her outfits, so she usually wears those ones with a solid color shirt. My nieces are also happy with theirs. The ones that were actually too small for my daughter were the ones that I gifted to my nieces, which turned out great because they fit both of my nieces good. <br /><br />Overall I am ok with this set. They were a great money saver and great for gifting. The hairbands are cute and little girls love them. Even with the few minor flaws I would still get them again.",

I like the amount of product that comes in the tube and that it lasts a decent amount of time with daily use. It feels good on my skin and gives my eyelids a primer to stick to as well.

I was pretty sure this was going to be given away to someone at that point. Then I got out of the shower and styled my hair and it looked really nice and all the brassiness was gone.

I also don't really like messages on my cups, so would have preferred that to be plain or with a graphic/picture design. The cup itself is good and has a nice sliding lid that fits quite snuggly.

It’s a bad buy.<br /><br />In those stars I try to include: How closely the product meets the description, Price, How it compares to other products I’ve tried, and Usability.<br /><br />My reviews can be long, so if you want to skim, follow the topic headers. Also-I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My nail experience:<br />I am currently NOT a nail tech but I am practicing to become licensed. It’s something I enjoy—but is still a hobby.  I practice weekly, if not daily- on myself, hand mannequins, and other people. Sometimes I’m told to hurry up getting licensed- that I’m \"good enough\"—but I’m in no hurry, busy trying out as many products as I can, watching nail content on YouTube and SkillShare.<br />SO--Though I am knowledgeable, I recommend you always trust licensed nail teaches over me.<br /><br />Art liner brushes-- overall look:<br />I'm a sucker for the embedded crystals look that these brushes have. Its a common look for nail brushes- this style is everywhere, but I always find it pretty. The crystals are loose, wiggling around in the open center- sometimes making a faint clicking noise. This style always looks bougie to me.<br /><br />The brush tips:<br />these preform fine- had a few brush hairs I had to get wet and smooth-- nothing bad. after a little forming they do what they are intended to do. If you're new to brushes like these, the long fine lines help create smoother thin lines and the stubby brushes are good for more precise detail.<br /><br />Cost:<br />At the time of this review these brushes cost 6.99. for five brushes that's roughly 1.25 for each brush. Not a bad cost. You can get better brushes- they'll have less imperfections and will cost more-- but these do fine.<br /><br />I see these brushes everywhere-- and the'll randomly pop up at different price points- sometimes even as a free bonus for a more expensive nail kit. So if you want to shop around you may be able to find them cheeper-- but I still think this is a good price.<br /><br />Overall:<br />They are what they say they are.  If you like the look on the page- I don't think they will disappoint.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!",

This Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener, however, is in a class all by itself. Even the box it comes in is beautiful, with soft sweeping white and beige brush strokes in the background and beautiful flowers embossed in gold. The pattern wraps all the way around the box, with each side being different. The inside of the box is a vivid lime green. The spray bottle for the air freshener looks more like a perfume bottle, light and dark pink with more of the gold embossing, this time with leaves instead of flowers. The key ingredients of this air freshener are water, hibiscus oil, and hydrogenated castor oil. The bottle contains 3.38 fl oz (100 ml). The directions say to wash linens and clothes before spraying this linen mist on them. It says this spray can be used on sheets, furniture fabric, drapes, pillows, and directly in the room as an air freshener. It also says to shake the bottle well before using it. When sprayed, the hibiscus scent is very subtle and faint, but definitely there. My wife had me spray some on the blouse she was wearing so that she could enjoy the hibiscus scent all day long, and she plans to spray her pillow before she goes to sleep. For a soft, gentle hibiscus aroma that stays pleasantly in the background without overwhelming my senses, this Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener works well.",

                "text": "This comes in a nice outer product box. Made in Korea. The brand’s website said it’s 100% vegan, excluding animal ingredients and animal experiments. It also doesn’t include parabens.<br /><br />It comes in a nice compact. It’s a compact like a cushion foundation where you open it and there’s a kind of lid that holds the sponge applicator, and you lift that lid to reveal the product. You press the applicator sponge into it (or your own sponge or brush) and then apply it. The brand’s website said the included sponge applicator is an “eco puff” made of “eco-friendly corns” and is “99.9% anti-bacterial and water-repellent,” which makes it safe on skin and keeps puff clean.<br /><br />This is a liquidy but balm kind of texture. It isn’t as thick as a balm. It just feels like a cushion foundation. But this isn’t a foundation. It has a very light, mint green color to it. It’s so light that it’s almost white but has the green color to it. When applied, it reduces redness. It doesn’t do as well as my more pigmented green correctors, but it does a nice job while being hydrating and lightweight on the skin. It’s something that works well before applying foundation. It is lightweight enough to wear well under foundation. It isn’t a primer really, it doesn’t smooth out the skin or fill in pores. But, it does reduce the redness in my skin so then I use less foundation and concealer. If you have a TON of redness or it’s REALLY red, this might not be enough since it isn’t extremely pigmented. But, it will make a difference. I like it isn’t drying on the skin either.<br /><br />I’m just not sure how I feel about it though. It works well on the skin. But, I do like to know what’s in my products. I don’t like that they provided barely any product info, and the ingredients on the product box weren’t in English. They also didn’t include them here on the product page. Not even the product photos provided any real info on the product - what it does, who it’s for, how to use it, ingredients, etc. I had to go to the brand’s website to find out more. Yes, it’s a simple Google search, but it’s not really something you  should have to do.<br /><br />Normally, I would just go to the brand’s website to find the list of ingredients when they’re not included on the Amazon product page. But, the Jung Saem Mool website didn’t have them on their website either. I looked for them elsewhere and did find an ingredient list on Korean Beauty Box, but didn’t think they were accurate because they didn’t include centella asiatica, pine sprout, or green calamine powder, which are supposed to be in this product. So, I translated the ingredients from the box myself. But, I’m not that confident in the ingredients provided on the box.(I included a photo from the box, and also included the ingredients at the end of my review in English)<br /><br />It doesn’t seem like a complete list of ingredients to me. It has the first ingredient as titanium dioxide. It has tocopherol (vitamin E) as the 3rd ingredient. The rest of the ingredient are 7, kind of versions I’d guess you’d call them, of centella asiatica. There’s nothing else listed. It’s kind of odd. The brand’s website said this is supposed to have “2 plants - pine sprout containing fresh moisture and centella asiatica roots.” I saw the “centella asiatica roots” in the ingredients when I translated them. But didn’t see any “pine sprout.” I also saw something about “cica pine water” on the brand’s website, but again, not sure what that’s supposed to be? The brand’s website also mentioned “Natural green calamine powder covers reddened skin tone.” Again, I didn’t see any calamine powder at all in the ingredients.<br /><br />The 7, I guess versions, of Centella Asiatica are:<br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) - Well known soothing, antioxidant, and moisturizing ingredient. Anti-inflammatory. The main biologically active components are Asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. All of which are in this.<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm)<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm)<br /><br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica. It’s less prominent than it’s sister component, Asiaticoside, but it still contributes to the well-established moisturizing and wound healing abilities of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Overall, it works well. It reduces my redness, feels hydrating on the skin, and works well on its own and under foundation. It feels lightweight on the skin. If they provided the full ingredient list, it would be something I’d be willing to purchase. But, right now, I don’t like they didn’t include them and don’t like that they can’t even be found online as far as I could tell. And I just have a hard time believing the ingredient list I translated from the box is the full ingredient list. I don’t know. If the ingredients aren’t a big factor for you, this is nice and works well. If knowing the ingredients are important to you, I’d look elsewhere. There’s other similar products that actually provide a full ingredient list, and a lot of them are far cheaper. I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />How to Use (from brand’s website):<br />Use as last step of skin care routine. Dip puff into content and gently apply and dab on skin.<br /><br />Special Tips (from brand’s website)<br />Carry it in makeup bag or purse for easy supply of moisture to skin when it dries up.<br />Use as lightweight skin tone corrector to correct sensitive skin tone covered by masks instead of applying heavy, caking makeup.<br /><br />FULL INGREDIENTS<br />Ingredients | Titanium dioxide (CI 77891], Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm), Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm), Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm), Madecassoside (0.0025ppm), Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm), Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm), Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm)<br /><br />**NOTE: Just for reference, 1ppm = 0.0001% (or 10,000 ppm = 1%). So…<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) = 515.9235%<br />*5,159,235ppm is parts per million, so it means there’s 5,159,235 parts of Centella Asiatica in one million molecules<br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm) = 0.0000035%<br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm) = 0.000003%<br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%",

And you probably would need two coats to cover any dark spots and even out your skin tone. I exfoliate my face three times a week and I feel the foundation sits better on my skin when I do. The formula is light. The primer is supposed to smooth out your skin. So I mainly use it on my T zone where I have larger pores. And I apply a super glowy and dewy primer on the rest of my face. I like to apply some foundation with my finger and spread it around on my face and then I go with one of the sponges. The sponges feel a little dense. Make sure you wet them before blending the foundation. These sponges work better damp. They don’t absorb the foundation too much, which is great. The foundation blends beautifully and gives me enough coverage to cover my imperfections. I do like to set it with powder as well and it usually works great under powder. I’d like to set it because I feel like it lasts all day long then when I don’t. Make sure you hydrate your skin very well before applying this foundation. I love how it looks on my skin.",

The salt flakes are really coarse and uncomfortable to rub against the skin. It’s suppose to exfoliate not rub off the skin. Like goodness. I started using it on my calloused feet and it didn’t really hurt and made a little bit of a difference. But as for like legs, arms and things like that? I definitely wouldn’t use it on those places. It also leaves a thick film/residue. Much too oily in my opinion. It does smell nice though but overall, I’m just not impressed unfortunately.

Such a great way to reuse, reduce and recycle! This is great for both beards and mustaches. It has somewhat of a matte finish and love the ingredients used to make this balm. It applies incredibly smoothly and looks great. Highly recommend!",
