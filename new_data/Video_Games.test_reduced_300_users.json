My only complaint is the thread they used to hold the light bar around the outside of the pad is very rough. Because of the side my forearm sits on it, and it gets irritated sometimes in long gaming sessions. I have found if I put a washcloth, or other mousepad over it if I am planning to be playing a while its better. But this covers the lighting and is not really as aesthetically. pleasing.

                "title": "The game is afoot!",
                "text": "Frogwares' seventh installment of Sherlock Holmes is absolutely stunning. With incredibly lifelike modeling and rendering (you can practically count the pores on characters faces), a wide range of immersive environments with real-time effects (blowing leaves, running water, etc.), and plenty of intrigue to keep both Holmes and Watson busy, the game most certainly is afoot.<br /><br />Crimes and Punishments is not a linear story; rather, it is made up of six separate games loosely connected by the appearance of the Merry Men, a gang of terrorists. Several of the stories are taken from canon (Black Peter, Abbey Grange).<br /><br />As you play through the first case, on-screen guidance explains the gameplay basics. As Sherlock, you have several tools at your disposal, including a research library of encyclopedias and newspapers, a laboratory where you will be required to perform different types of chemical analyses, and Toby, the best nose in the British empire. You also have a full wardrobe of potential disguises including a makeup table; this will be of importance at several points in the game. At certain points, you have the chance to switch between Sherlock and Watson, a constable, and Toby, the “best nose in the British Empire.”<br /><br />There are several new features here from previous installments of Frogwares’ series, including Sherlock's mind palace, where you visually connect glowing synapses as new clues are unearthed, leading you to a series of possible conclusions as to the culprit(s). Depending on the conclusions you reach, various suspects will be pronounced guilty. Sherlock then has the additional responsibility of deciding whether to arrest or absolve each killer. Another feature is Sherlock's in-depth analysis of characters; you have the ability to slowly pan over each suspect, and Sherlock points out various facts that will enable you to unlock key plot points based on these observations. Sherlock also has two additional tools in his arsenal; one allowed you to observe details that others would miss (this is accomplished through a filter than also distorts background sounds), and the other allows you to mentally recreate an object (this is a mini puzzle in itself as each “mental object” requires manipulation to function).<br /><br />The locations range from grimy London alleys to Roman ruins, elaborate Chinese temples, and stately manors. Each felt totally unique and distinct from the others; in fact I was floored by the attention to detail and number of explorable areas as other detective games I have played give a much smaller venue.  In addition to puzzles (which range from frequently easy to very difficult), there are a series of mini-games that involve boxing, archery, chemical analysis, recreating objects, and a whole lot of lockpicking. These mini games can be skipped, which will drastically shorten the length of the game. It’s also obvious that the mini games were designed with console gaming in mind, as accomplishing some of them on a computer keyboard (without a joypad) is pretty much impossible, but I was able to accomplish most of them successfully.<br /><br />I found the length of the cases to be a bit uneven; for example, the first, second, and fourth cases felt shorter in comparison to the other three. I also felt the second case was the weakest of the six as the locations all felt extremely repetitive and I had deduced the basic plot very early into my investigation. The disguise feature is a great idea, but it seems to only have an effect at a couple of points in the game; it would have been interesting to see how suspects and NPCs reacted to Sherlock depending on his outfit at a given time. I would have also liked to see greater weight placed on the morality system; you are notified if you made the correct deduction, then told what percentage of fellow Steam gamers made the same judgment call. Once you make a final decision, the game erases all save points for that case, so if you want to see various endings, be sure to do so BEFORE accepting the final decision.<br /><br />There are also a number of awards that can be earned for accomplishing various cases, conversations, and minigames, which adds to the replay value.<br /><br />Voice acting was generally excellent, with dialogue that felt true to the characters and the period. The banter between Sherlock and Watson (and Sherlock's jibes at Lestrade and his brother Mycroft) felt true to the original stories. Even Mrs. Hudson makes an appearance, as do the Baker Street Irregulars and Bill Wiggins, who play a key role in several of the cases.<br /><br />Fans of BBC Sherlock, the original Conan Doyle stories, and detective novels in general (especially if you are a fan of the older Agatha Christie PC games as I am) will find much to recommend Sherlock; the graphics are simply stunning, the environments are totally immersive, and the replay value is high as there are so many potential outcomes, optional clues, minigames, and awards to earn. This is truly one of the best and most impressive PC games I have played in the last decade.",

Ha!<br /><br />Choosing a replacement controller: I try for a happy, medium.. cheaper versions seem to have connectability issues and/or stops functioning for no reason- wasting $! I’ve also found higher $$$ does not always equate to durable or longevity!! Not interested in extra whistles/bells.. I’d rather just a solid build and ergonomic fit in the hand- and  this met our requirements!<br /><br />Built with a different body shape than the standard PS4 controller- it still has a nice reach for button control. Flippers feel substantial with expected response time. Paint/wrap is cool.. but, it’s just an aesthetic feature. Ha ha… obviously won’t Improve your game skills but, a nice identifier if playing with group- very unique.<br /><br />Connection to charge is snug..and this matters so, if plugged in overnite -it’s game ready the next day.

Once you have that straight, you're set. These headphones are made for the perfect gaming experience. The cups are comfortable for long-term wear. You can change the EQ mode to suit your preferences. The built-in mic is removable. The controls are very user-friendly. Overall, I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

                "text": "I am writing this review from the perspective not as a gamer but rather as a user who needs a comfortable pointing device. If you’re looking for reviews on what a wonderful gaming mouse this is, my review isn’t going to help you very much. If you instead want to know how it works for someone with big hands that does a lot of photo and drawing work, I have something to offer here.<br /><br />I have the hands of a gorilla (seriously, I can palm a basketball) and I have had a terrible time finding a mouse that actually fits my hand properly. Because of this I have spent a good deal of time researching other options for pointing devices that are comfortable, including writing/art tablets, track balls, pens and more. I was not thinking about this when I selected this mouse; instead, I was thinking of my son who is a gamer and is always looking for a better mouse. I’m keeping this one for myself.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews here mention that it is a claw-grip mouse, not a palm grip. I disagree, though I admit that I am not a typical user. It fits comfortably in my hand and I can rest the base of my palm on the desk and still reach the buttons comfortably without strain. This is good news for me, as most mice are small enough to require me to tuck in my thumb and contort my hand a little to get a good grip which just makes my hands cramp up.<br /><br />I used the USB dongle to connect to my systems, not Bluetooth, mainly because my Windows computer acts funny with other Bluetooth-based pointing devices. The system saw the dongle, loaded the drivers it needed and the mouse was dead as a doornail because it needed to be charged so it still did not work. I plugged it in, set the mouse to use the USB connection and it worked somewhat as a wired mouse while it charged (it was communicating via the dongle but getting power through the wire). Once charged I disconnected from the power source and it gave me no more issues.<br /><br />Operation is just as smooth and comfortable as I could hope. The buttons are firm but work well. I have tried all of the “standard” buttons and they work just fine – left-click, right-click, page forward, page backward and scroll. These are all I really need, though I like having the other buttons available should I need them later.<br /><br />The precision is good and it works well for pixel-peeping when working with digital images. That’s about as close to gaming as I will get with this mouse. I need precision, not speed.<br /><br />So, the main event for me: I plugged in the dongle in my Linux laptop and set the mouse to talk to it. I did not have access to all of the extra programmable buttons but the basic functions worked which is all I really need.<br /><br />I realize I am not the normal user for such a mouse as this, but in my case this mouse works well for me and I am very pleased. It fits my hands very well and it just works.",

                "text": "Update 8/31/20: Upgrading back to 5/5 stars! Turns out I accidentally turned motion control on without knowing it. Once I found that and turned it off the issue was gone.<br /><br />Please ignore my negative comment below.<br /><br />I bought this controller in January 2020 and up until the last week or so (August 2020) it was working great and I absolutely loved it. I was totally fine with paying what I did and would’ve happily done so again.<br /><br />Unfortunately around last week my controller started having an issue where the left analog stick was drifting the the left and nothing could fix it. I tried recalibrating the stick in the Nintendo Switch settings and it would fix it for about 30 seconds before it started drifting again.<br /><br />This issue is particularly noticeable in games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe where my racer will start drifting to the left which makes racing almost impossible since I can’t control my own car drifting while racing.<br /><br />Sadly my warranty expired and I’m really annoyed that I paid so much only for it to break in less than a year. I take good care of it and always wash my hands before playing so it’s not an issue of poor treatment of the controller.<br /><br />I hope other people don’t have this issue but felt I should mention it since it happened to me.",

                "text": "The Hori Digital Controller for the GameCube is one of my “grail” controllers. For over a decade I've casually eyed this controller, seeing its price rise from high double digits to what it is now. Still, I don't think the price is that bad for such a unique controller. I love it when companies take their own, fresh perspective on standard controller layouts without making them unwieldy. Comfort is usually the driving force for change, as well as quality-of-life improvements. 8BitDo has been doing a fantastic job in this regard, and now Retro Fighters isn't far behind.<br /><br />Retro Fighters (“RF”) is doing wonderful things in the controller world. My first controller was the Brawler64 when it came out in different colors. (While I was aware of the Kickstarter, I avoided it out of personal reasons with Kickstarter itself.) It was love at first touch. It perfectly conformed to my hand and felt wonderful. The d-pad could use some refinement, but overall it's great. Fast-forwarding through a bunch of controllers, we arrive at the BladeGC. I knew I had to have it. Initially, I thought 8BitDo would release a controller like this, or at least some other company, so I was super excited when Retro Fighters announced it. Though I'd still like to get the Hori one some day, it's no longer a must; it's wired and doesn't have features for modern systems. Let's list the upgrades:<br />- grip<br />- analog sticks<br />- two more shoulder buttons<br />- vibration<br />- Switch/PC buttons<br />- wireless (and 2.4 GHz to boot!), with both a dongle for the GameCube and one for USB<br /><br />Already this is the perfect upgrade to the Hori Digital Controller. The little Z button is missing on the front, but of course it's not a requirement.<br /><br />I'll start with commenting on the d-pad. It's…phenomenal. I'm *very* picky about d-pads. Nintendo's of course are best, with Hori a close second. 8BitDo's may feel nice, but they have a habit of mis-presses. This can be remedied by opening the controller and applying binder reinforcement tabs; not ideal, but definitely alleviates the issue. But this d-pad? Damn… My thumb *skates* across it. When I first opened it, I was a bit disappointed with how it felt. It's low and has straight corners. But during play is when I noticed how marvelous it is. I tried Crash Team Racing, Stardew Valley, and Shredder's Revenge. Every input was precise and correct, and my thumb was able to just skate across it with speed and accuracy. Mein Gott.<br /><br />I haven't extensively used the analog sticks since I didn't get this controller for them, but I tested them with Smash. There's an octagonal gate for each stick, and each movement was comfortable and, for the time I spent using them, precise as well. They're smooth but don't let your thumbs slide off. The tops are flat, with the outer ring (textured for gripping pleasure) jutting up just enough to prevent thumbs from steering off. They don't have as wide an area to move as the GameCube controller, or maybe that's because they're not as tall, but they work well enough. Because of how wonderful this controller feels, I now plan to get the BattlerGC.<br /><br />The vibration is subtle. I'm unsure whether there's an option to change the strength, but the manual doesn't indicate that so I don't think so. It's not too low so as not to feel it; in fact, I think it's the perfect strength if you prefer a little feedback without it dominating the hands. I've had some third-party controllers that freakin' rattled the whole controller. Super uncomfortable. The BladeGC's gives you just a small jolt to remind you that you got hit, loser.<br /><br />And the wireless connectivity? A non-issue. Since this is not Bluetooth, it can't be used with the Switch when in handheld mode; instead, the USB dongle plugs directly to the dock. The Switch then reads it as a wired controller (which must be turned on in settings) and away you go. There is no discernible lag from what I noticed.<br /><br />Now on to the “bad.”<br /><br />Material. The controller is already light enough, but the quality of the plastic is very light and feels hollow. There is no grip texture. Rather, the whole thing is smooth and my hands can slide a bit easily. This is something I noticed with other RF controllers, so I know it isn't just this. Based on how it feels, it doesn't feel like a premium controller, though I certainly consider it one.<br /><br />Stick placement. There is little distance between the right stick and the B button. I have relatively small hands (5'8\", so whatever size hand that coordinates to) and haven't moved the stick accidentally, but I always feel it when pressing the B button. This made me wonder how people with bigger thumbs will experience the controller.<br /><br />But that's it. No more bad. Everything good. Oh, maybe the back shoulder buttons. I prefer ones that stop with a noticeable press, but these go just straight down like a lot of modern shoulder buttons. Gross. Maybe the sticks can be bigger too, but I'll wait until I try the BattlerGC to comment on that.<br /><br />This will be my main controller for RPGs, or any other game that utilizes the d-pad and A button a lot.<br /><br />B for materials and stick placement, A+ for everything else.",

                "text": "[[VIDEOID:27650cd0317fc1e6114d8bac39cb39d6]] These headphones sound really good. They're not world class but as far as affordable headphones go these fit the bill. I listened to a variety of music, classical, jazz, rock, prog, metal and using the Bass mode EQ/sound effect setting. I'm very amused the headphones pronounce bass like the fish. Other than Bass mode these have; Classic and Vocal modes.<br />Bass mode worked well once I adjusted the equalizers in my tablet and phone. A little fish, I mean bass, heavy but the highs are there, fairly sharp and clear.<br />Classic mode is the happy medium setting. I find this is good for listening to YouTube channels where someone is talking/reacting to something.<br />Vocal mode. . . Maybe good for phone calls? Unfortunately I didn't receive or make any calls. Honestly this mode made everything sound horrible.<br />The lighting is rather cool you can have static single colors, I was particularly fond of the green and red they're very vibrant but all the colors are well done. Then you can have your single color pulse/fade in and out, next you you can cycle all the colors one after the other. Finally you can have a color chasing rainbow where all the colors display and cycle around in a circle. This is my favorite mode. My only complaint is you can't see the groovy colors when you're wearing the headphones!<br />The microphone on these is clever. There's just a small nub not much bigger than a pencil's eraser that protrudes from the front of the left side.  you gently pull on this to extend the microphone boom. It easily slides back into the headphone. It appears that even though the unit has a memory function, remembering color settings and which sound mode you used, you apparently have to mute the microphone each time you power on the unit.<br />Fit and finish are good, not great, I've got a kinda large head and these are just the slightest bit tight but I'd rather that than loose. I used them for a couple hours last night then fell asleep with them on and woke up hours later. They can be worn a long time. Cups are nicely soft and breathe okay. In a warm room you may sweat. I'm not sure these are suitable for kids or irresponsible teens/adults. The hinges that allow you to lay these flat look like metal but they're plastic. Heavy play, flexing too much and they'll break. They're hefty but have a very soft pad that sits on top of your head.<br />Battery life seems to be excellent. I had the rainbow colors cycling and had them powered on for over nine hours and they were playing at least six, my tablet rebooted sometime after I fell asleep.<br />As an affordable set of headphones that sound pretty dang good (adjust your devices EQ if it has one) have long battery life and fit well these are something I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />P. S.<br />I know some reviewers have said these are too quiet or very quiet. I don't blast my ears like I did growing up (I'm 56) so with the volume on the headset maxed and each device having the sound up, never maxed, these were more than loud enough to hear everything I listened to.<br /><br />Edit - A couple things to add.<br />• I wear glasses, these are reasonably when wearing glasses.<br />• I needed to open the headband up two notches on each side for a better fit. I just wanted to note that the corners of the plastic exposed when opened are pointy and quite sharp!<br />• Had an accidental durability test the other day. I was sitting in my wheelchair when a nurse came in to talk to me. I pushed my headphones up and a little too far. They fell approximately four feet onto a tile floor. Absolutely no damage.<br />• If you put these on and can't hear anything even after checking the volume in whatever app you're using and your system settings. Check the volume wheel on the headset, It's really easy to accidentally roll it all the way down.",

I didn't get any sound out of it at first (except for it telling me that it was powered on or politely saying goodbye) until it was fully charged, and then everything fell into place after that. It needs to be paired with the PS3 first as instructed or you cannot set it as your input/output device in the PS3 settings.<br /><br />There are three modes - game, movie and music. With game mode, you can choose from eight presets to enhance your gaming experience. There are also about eight presets for chatting, some of which can alter the sound of your voice. In addition, you can plug your headset into your computer and go to the Turtle Beach website (http://www.turtlebeach.com/community/preset-community) to customize the sounds of your favorite games to give yourself a competitive advantage, or to immerse yourself in the game through the use of audio presets and voice prompts. You will need to register to get access to the customization tools and to download Turtle Beach and Community created audio presets.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent for game play, (for example, you can hear the footsteps of your opponents even before they come around a corner) as well as for chatting with other players while playing. In addition, the earphones are very comfortable for long hours of use and block out any surrounding noise.<br /><br />Another great feature is the Dolby surround sound. There are six easily accessible settings that you can use to get the effects to suit your current gaming mood.<br /><br />It takes about 6 hours to charge, but this is not a problem as you can continue playing while it is charging. The manufacturer states that a full charge lasts about 15 hours, but due to real life interruptions I have not been able to verify this.<br /><br />The headset can be paired via Bluetooth to two Bluetooth enabled devices simultaneously. For example, you can chat via your PS3 when playing a game and still receive/make phone calls, but I haven't tried the phone part as yet. There are separate Bluetooth volume controls on the right ear cup to adjust the chat/phone volume (Game volume controls are on the left ear cup)<br /><br />Finally, using the mobile device cable supplied, you can plug it into any regular earphone jack and the headset can now be used as regular earphones with your audio device (music/MP3 player, computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.)<br /><br />Overall, the sound is great and truly enhances your entire gaming experience.",

Most ear buds are too big and cause pain within minutes or just fall out. Since this set comes with multiple bud sizes, I decided to try one more time.<br /><br />I've used these several times over the past few days with my LG V10 phone and two different Fire tablets. The plug is tight and there's no feedback or static listening to music or a video. The cord is long enough to comfortably have your device on your lap or in a pocket, but it isn't so long that it becomes unwieldy or tangle prone.<br /><br />The sound is surprisingly good and crisp with rock, country and even classical music. The different ear buds are for treble and base enhancement, depending on your desire. Nonetheless, the smallest set (clear in color) for treble fits my ears without falling out or pinching. The little carry pouch is exactly the right size to stash in my purse or carry on luggage. Since these actually fit me and sound good, I will be able to use these rather than a headphone style while doing dressage schooling (horseback riding).

                "text": "They say evolution is a series of mistakes.  In that sense, this certainly evolves the series.<br /><br />While some Final Fantasies have suffered from being too linear or having a slow, lethargic battle system, where you are constantly harassed by useless battles.. this one swings (for my taste) much too far in the opposite direction.<br /><br />They wanted open world, but the world almost feels TOO open.. I know that sounds a little silly, but the sidequests (of which there are many) feel almost pointless.  You want to do them.. but there is so much travel time involved, that you may just wind up opting out.  Which brings me to point 2 of the world being &#34;too open&#34;.  I've spent probably half of the 20 hours I have been playing the game so far as a passenger in a car or driving a car to a location.  Sometimes you can &#34;fast travel&#34;, but for some reason loading times seem almost as long as the 5 minutes of travel time.  This is not a game you are going to play if you have 30 minutes to kill, because you probably aren't going to really get to do anything.<br /><br />The battle system is an absolute mess.  Fans of the series... understand turn based battle is completely gone, as is major coordination with your party.  You really only control your character and then some special moves for your party members.  If you equip them with spells, they may cast them on you if you are in the wrong spot.  20+ hours in and I feel as if the battle system is little more than button mashing.  The entire concept of strategy seems to be gone.  You can change to (as I did) the &#34;wait&#34; battle mode, which is supposed to allow you to feel more turn based, but it doesn't really help.  It lets you choose your personal next target, but that is about it.  Often times you are fighting a dozen or more enemies at once and suddenly dozens of arrows appear on the screen and you just wind up thinking &#34;whatever, I'll just keep mashing the O&#34;<br /><br />Unlike other Final Fantasy games, this one almost seemed to be based in the real world, with only slight tweaks.  They travel in a car, contact each other on cell phones.  Yes, you have Daemons and such, but when you have to pull up to a gas station that looks exactly like a highway rest stop, you feel as if some of the fantasy is missing.  One of the things I used to love about Final Fantasy was its ability to create whole new worlds that are only very loosely based on ours.  This feels much more like they took our world and threw in a few tweaks to make it into a Final Fantasy game.  (I know that is not how it evolved, but the final product has that feel).<br /><br />I get that they wanted the game to evolve.. but so many of these &#34;evolutions&#34; (Battle system, open world with endless travel time, based so close t the real world) feel like mistakes that will drive away long time fans and, for me, the story hasn't been engrossing enough to pull me in.<br /><br />I got this game on release day and have played it mostly on weekends, but this weekend, I realized I didn't touch it.  I just didn't want to spend half my time watching scenery go by or deciding whether I want to bother with sidequests or just get on with the story... a story I don't feel invested in the way I did other FF.<br /><br />FF has been my go to game for close to 20 years now and whenever a new one comes out I tell my wife.. well, prepare not to see me for a while.<br /><br />Well.. that hasn't happened with FF XV.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and play this game to be taken away to a whole new world and engrossed in a story and enjoy the strategic combat from previous games?  Rent it first and try it out before you buy it, because you may not like what you get!",

                "text": "Well, now that I have tried it, I can say that I really just prefer my usual simple silicone cover, a good sweat band, and the inclusion of a cut up puppy pad/incontinence pad placed between forehead and sweatband (sweatband holds it in place). Be sure it doesnt have attractants, and you'll find it a game changer for mopping up sweat and reducing/eliminating fog. The other thing I do is have a fan running near by. Never had any fog. I tried this because a lot of people seem to like the built in fan when playing hot sweaty fitness games like Supernatural. That is what I play, actually it is all I play. So being comfortable is important, and my DIY system seems to work fine. But I was curious, and while it works, it comes down to preference. Just so you know, this fan style is more for air movement around the unit, not a direct blast to face. I think that is what some people may think a fan of this style is. It is more for keeping moisture/fog from building on lens, and it totally works.<br /><br />Maybe I will have better idea once we get into some super hot humid weather. Maybe it will make a greater difference then. I will report back on that. Easy enough to hook up.<br /><br />Does not impede head strap use<br /><br />Does not interfere with charging docks (like anker)",

It has a faceplate you can swap out, but nowhere can you buy other faceplates, so why list it as a feature? The worst, the controller has very little control. If say, I want to turn my character left, on other game pads, I can turn them slowly left, or quickly left, based on how far I press the joystick. On this one though, it is hard to turn my character slowly left, and aiming is crazy hard because of that.<br /><br />This is subjective; but this thing is tiny, clearly for kids or people with small hands.

                "text": "PACKAGING<br /><br />Amazon did a fantastic job packing. It had four custom fitted foam padding on each corners. I took this for granted, until I saw how other merchants packed their gear, which was just thrown into a box with barely any padding.<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSION<br /><br />I didnt like the intro music. It deviated from the atmosphere created by prior Souls series starting from Demon's souls.  Didnt like the remake intro either. But Im used to it now.  There isnt much music in older Souls games. But what little it had, was perfectly suited to the world.  Elden rings, other than the intro, is no exception.  In Elden Rings, there is music almost all the time.  The compositions are perfectly suited for the world and paints a wonderful picture.  Beautiful with bleak and dark undertones.<br /><br />35 HOURS IN:<br /><br />Character creation- Alot of interesting possibilities including cosmetics, which wasnt much of a focal point in the past.<br /><br />Graphics- Top notch. Beautiful artwork.  The only issue is inconsistent 60FPS even in performance mode.  But not choppy at all.  Performance mode highly recommended. Quality mode looks good when standing still but otherwise I wouldnt use it.<br /><br />Gameplay- Dedicated Jumping on foot and horseback adds a vertical dimension to Souls games which makes it more interesting to play by giving more strategic options to tackle bosses and areas.<br /><br />Overworld- interesting and actually fun and not just mindless wandering unlike other games. Game gives you subtle directional clues to major areas of the game but still get to decide where you want to go.  I didnt realize this until 30 hours in as I wanted this to be a completely blind run and not reading any youtube videos.  Its easy to get around and many transfer/resting stations.  I usually dont like open world games because there is just alot of random filler/boring things to do.  But this game was truly an except for me.  I really enjoyed exploring on horseback.<br /><br />Dungeon/Castle combat- side areas are easy and straightfoward understandably but the major areas have the same souls like intricacy and detail.  Enemy/Boss AI is top notch and fun.  It can get incredibly difficult.  Just spend time on it and get to understand the timing and moves.<br /><br />Story- same as prior series. A bit sparse by todays \"standard\", but less so than prior Souls games. Still need to piece things together and use your imagination.  It takes a while for the story to unfold. Games/Movies today are often too verbose that it leaves little to the imagination.<br /><br />Difficulty- Easier than prior souls games.  It seems that they have more respawn/transfer stations, which makes backtracking and progressing easier.  Also, a much bigger stamina pool to start off, which means you dont have to raise this stat unless you want a tank/block build.  This makes the game easier in some sense.  In other Souls games you dont have to raise it either even if you played the glass cannon builds, but the stamina pools were smaller and so you had to be more offensively selective and strategic. There are also more clues as to where to go. The map is well done and interactive allowing you to pin areas of interest.  Also they give you summoning options in certain areas, which makes it easy for you to do damage while the npcs tank for you.  Works on many bosses. Not all.  You still have the option of summoning other players.<br /><br />I personally take it slow to soak it all in to enjoy this wonderful creation.  I try to avoid grinding/power leveling and collecting every little thing while playing unless Im stuck for a while.  Its fun figuring out how to beat bosses. Its part of the fun.  On difficult bosses, I usually spend one night dying over and over again, thinking through strats and then the next day I beat it rather quickly. Which makes me wonder why I couldnt do it before.  I find this a rewarding experience.  Usually im underpowered so my strats have to be perfect. But obviously there are ways around this by leveling up more or just coming back to that area later on after accumulating better equipment.",

To sum it up, design, quality, sound, comfort are all average to slightly above. If you expected top of the line headset at this price point that is putting unrealistic expectation on the product.<br /><br />The design could be improved to increase flexibility and range of motion of the ear cups. That would improve comfort.  Not every head is shaped the same.<br /><br />Sound could be better but the sound works just fine. It is clear and loud all though you do not have the atmosphere of a higher priced headset such as Astro.  It’s not a deep rich sound you would find with a Higher end gaming headset.<br /><br />The microphone could be improved to better the noise cancellation. That would help it not pick up as much background noise.  Also, it could have a swivel mic mute in addition to a button.  It is hard to find the button.<br /><br />The headset connects easily via the USB transmitter or blue tooth.  I had no issues connecting to my PC or using the USB transmitter with my sons PlayStation 5.  Note, it’s is only for PS not Xbox.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good affordable headset for entry level gaming or evening office work like I use it for.

                "text": "As an old, retired guy I spend a lot of time online gaming every day. My favorite MMO is complex enough that I use three computers while gaming. The main one is for the game itself. A second one is for Discord so I can easily track who is talking and/or any text messages sent on that app. The third window is for the game's wiki and various other information sites that I often need to reference on the fly. As you can imagine, three computers on a desktop makes for some clutter. So the smaller size of this keyboard is very nice. That smaller size does come with some issues though that gamers particularly need to be aware of.<br /><br />For one thing, there is no number pad and the function keys have been combined with the number keys. For me as a gamer, those kinds of changes have several ramifications. Most keyboards are standardized enough that switching to a new one is no big deal. In this case though, with significant changes to the keyboard arrangement, this one requires a learning curve to train the muscle memory to the new arrangement. My favorite game also uses a lot of keybinds. So, removing the number pad while combining the number and function keys, removes a noticeable amount of possible keybinds. The final issue I've had with this keyboard is that it's smaller size and novel arrangement means that I am hitting the wrong keys a significant number of times. That is not a good thing when the combat in your game is hot and heavy.<br /><br />There is one other thing of note about this product. The white keyboard and it's light show looks like it was designed for a pre-teen who is into rainbows and pink unicorns. I don't have any strong reaction either way to that design aesthetic myself. Other folks may love it or hate it though so just be aware of that in case such things matter to you.<br /><br />The de-cluttering usefulness of the smaller size is useful enough for me to give this keyboard a 4 star rating. I'll just put it on the machine I use the least and certainly won't use it on my gaming machine. That way I get the big advantage without worrying about it's disadvantages.",

I hestitated to upgrade considering the reviews for users with smaller hands were so poor, but I am in love with this new Tartarus keypad.<br /><br />I see a lot of users comparing it to the Nostromo, and while I understand the argument of size, it's also important to take into account there is an additional entire row of keys on the Tartarus. Mind you, that missing row of keys drove me INSANE and I am so happy they added it. Sure they are a bit more challenging to reach with smaller hands, but in gaming I have them as programed as my numbered inventory and in editing for less used keys.<br /><br />The padding is really soft and the product is very durable and feels superior in it's quality compared to the Nostromo. The d-pad is night and day compared to the old model and much easier to use. The only physical draw back I've found after several hours of use so far is the scroll wheel feels somewhat fragile.<br /><br />The software is very simple to use and still offers a seemingly endless amount of options to personalize the device's use. Having my mouse work seamlessly with the device, and even together with programing options, is a huge plus.<br /><br />If you have smaller hands and are transitioning from the Nostromo it's important to remember the addition of the 4th row (which is fabulous). If you are using a razer keypad for the first time, I would suggest some patience and assure you that you will grow to love it.<br /><br />Well worth it.",

Once it was done you have to go through the steps to set it up/calibrate it. The instructions say the camera has to be the same length from the tv as the size of the tv. I did this on a 40\" so I measured 40\" away, but ended up having to move it around when it needed to be calibrated. So you dont have to do what I did since it will have you calibrate it and ok it when it's at a good distance. It did take me about 2-3 minutes to calibrate. It seemed to lag as I moved the camera around to try to get the circle to match up with the one on the screen. Once you have it there, make sure you dont move it or your shots will be off. Also, the camera ended up being right in the middle of the tv so you would have to stand off to the side when youre playing the game. The game has different levels like sharks, etc., not just zombies. I think it's a fun game and something interactive, which is good for kids.",

                "text": "I am a makeup artist.  That means that I use all sorts of makeup from drugstore to high level professional.  There are many things about eye shadow that I look for which determine if it is something I can recommend.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This came with no padding, no protection in a plastic mailer with no bubble cushioning.  There is a plastic sheet over the surface of the eye shadow and no mirror in the case.  There is no brush.<br /><br />COLORS<br />The colors are beautiful.  They have nuances that are very difficult to capture on camera.  There are matte and shimmer colors- some of which are duochrome- something I look for in shadows.<br /><br />HOW TO USE THESE<br />These eye shadows (like almost all other brands of shadow from professional down to drugstore) are best used with a very good eye primer.  That will keep them in place and keep them intense too.  The only eyeshadow I have ever come across which can be used without a primer and great success is Viseart.<br /><br />QUALITY<br />These eye shadows are on a par with the high end cosmetics you find in the more expensive sections of makeup departments.  They have a good amount of pigmentation and are velvety smooth too including the mattes.<br /><br />MATTES<br />The mattes are not chalky, but are smooth and velvety.  They show up well but again, these are best used with a primer.<br /><br />SHIMMERS<br />These are some of the most gorgeous shimmer colors I have seen in a while.  The collection compliments each other beautifully and look stunning on the eyes and even just in swatches.<br /><br />ANY ISSUES<br />I have very sensitive eyes and these shadows did not cause any burning, watery eyes, or irritation of any kind the two days I wore them.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This set of eye shadows is gorgeous.  For the price, it is excellent quality and is on a par with shadows much more expensive than these are.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I LOVE these shadows.  The colors are gorgeous, quality excellent, and performance above most other shadows in this price range- just be sure to get a good eye shadow primer.",

However, after only 3 days it stopped working. It would not let me switch to manual so that I could adjust the fan to run at high speed for my gaming session. When it did work, the fan was loud no matter which speed it ran at. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing as I usually wear headphones while gaming but it is worth mentioning. The fan does fit perfectly and the USB connected cord is the perfect length to reach top back USB port of the Series X. It actually looked good too and I would have kept using it but unfortunately it no longer allows me to switch it to manual. Another thing I did not like was that it doesn't seem to allow you to switch between Celsius or Fahrenheit. It only shows Celsius. This was not a deal breaker but it was a little annoying.<br />Overall, had it not stopped working, I would have rated it at least a 3 star and possibly a 4 but as it stands currently (not working) it's a solid 1star.",

So, I was worried it was going to crack the screen. So, we decided to go back to our old case, as it felt a bit sturdier and safer for the game system. We'll just have to live without the space for the extra controllers until we can find a suitable alternative. I wouldn't recommend this case.",

If you're looking for something inexpensive in a mechanical kb, this is possibly worth considering, but you can get a lot more for just a little more money.  (Check ratings and reviews on a site like PCMag or Wirecutter.)<br /><br />The good: it's compact, and the mechanical keys are ok.  It has key backlighting (with brighness adjustment, see below).  That's it.<br /><br />Not for the not so good:<br /><br />The keys are a bit stiff, and typing on this is going to take an adjustment.  My much more expensive Razer keyboard is a whole lot smoother and has a significantly better feel.  (I no longer recommend Razer because their Synapse software is horrible, and is blocked by some corporate IT departments because of perceived vulnerabilities.)<br /><br />This is not an RGB keyboard (no colors): all you can do is adjust key brightness (using FN + F1/F2) through a few preset levels.  You can't customize anything.<br /><br />(Note that some reviewers complain about the side-by-side key symbols: that's what you get in a backlit mech keyboard, because the middle can't be lit, being blocked by the post.  IMO you get used to this pretty quickly.)<br /><br />Overall I can't recommend this, and I'm still considering returning it to Amazon.  I bought this because I needed something \"good enough\" in a hurry, and it was available and on sale.  In retrospect I should have spent a little more to get a better keyboard.",

                "title": "My Switch Lite is freaking adorable",
                "text": "Last Friday night I noticed my OEM switch shell was no longer closing correctly; likely due to case clips breaking during one of the two times I have replaced my left joystick (this Switch Lite has at leas 1000 hours of play time, and is the only Switch controller that I have had drift issues with). By midnight, I had fully fallen down the shell swap rabbit-hole.<br /><br />I decided on this pink case, but having a turquoise Switch Lite, I was apprehensive about the screen bezel as I don’t feel like a screen protector is the best solution.  Pretty soon, I had this shell, a “white” digitizer (which ended up actually being gray), a new LDC (because separating the original screen from the digitizer seemed like a good way to break it), thermal paste, screen adhesive, and a fan (because mine has been sounding a bit loud lately, but the one I ordered ended up not fitting, so I just cleaned the original one well and reinstalled it). Overall, the price was a bit much considering this was an impulse purchase in the middle of the night, but I did what I did and I don’t really have any regrets about it.<br /><br />The swap took a little over an hour to complete (remember, I didn’t remove the old screen, so I got done a little quicker - besides, this isn’t a race). It wasn’t too hard, but I had already disassembled my Switch Lite a couple times for joystick replacements, so I felt well prepared (plus I watched some videos and reviewed iFixIt’s screen replacement instructions).  I didn’t find anything to be terribly difficult, only tedious.  Anyone who has the right tools, takes their time, keeps track of their screws, and follows instructions shouldn’t have too much of an issue with this swap.  If you have ever replaced a joystick, you shouldn’t have much of an issue with this.<br /><br />Things to note: The finish on this case feels velvety soft- very pleasant in the hand. It makes me wonder how it will hold up to wear and use in the long term though.  I have seem some reviews that show what looks like the finish wearing off, but those switches were put into cases.  I haven’t seen anyone who uses their switch lite naked complaining of issues- only time will tell.  This case also has a less than 1mm gap along the top and bottom - isn’t really anything that will ruin my day, but I felt it needed to be mentioned since I can’t account for it (putting the tiniest amount of pressure on the case closes the gap - I made sure my screws in the back of the case were tight, but still, there is a gap). Other than that, I am very happy with the way this turned out :)<br /><br />Tips for success:<br />-Have the right tools.  You will need 00 Philips, 00 Tri-wing, Spudgers, adhesive (in case the screen adhesive isn’t usable when you remove the old one or want to use a new one), thermal paste (it isn’t really expensive and will save your device from overheating), heat gun (if you aren’t replacing the screen with a new one)<br />-Take your time - this isn’t a race.  A mod that takes 60 minutes instead of 4 hours is not worth it if you break your device.<br />-Clean as you go - If you are using a switch lite that has been around, you will likely find dust and grime inside, have some rubbing alcohol and canned air to clean anything you run into. Just make sure any alcohol you use has evaporated before turning the device back on.<br />-Replace any parts you have concerns about. The fan and joysticks are common parts that fail. If you have issues that you notice (loud fan or slight drift), use this opportunity to swap the part(s) while you are in there. That being said, the fan I bought ended up not fitting my Switch Lite - I cleaned it out well with cabbed air while the device was open (see Clean as you go) and it runs much better now.<br />-Follow instructions. iFixIt has a screen replacement guide that I followed.  It identified the screw type for each hole.  I separated my screws by size and had no problem grabbing the right one for each step when I reassembled.<br /><br />A little more on why I decided to replace my screen and digitizer.  At the end of the day, I wanted to end up with a mod that made me most happy and a screen protector wouldn’t do that (nor would a turquoise bezel around the screen).  In addition to being a better fit for my desired outcome, it gave me the flexibility to more easily move back into the old case if I ever felt the need (or ended up breaking the screen).  I considered trying to separate the digitizer, but decided it was too risky (in hindsight, it probably would have been fine). Even if, at the end of the day, the screen bezel ended up being gray, I feel like it is the best end product I could have ended up with and the one that makes me most happy.<br /><br />Update 9/22: this shell had me a little worried since the soft-touch finish feels like it will wear off with use. I am happy to report that I see no signs of an issue after 10 months of use. I will note that the shell makes the switch 7g heavier than the original for anyone interested.",

Bravely Default’s excellent job system also returns to add another layer of complexity to battles.<br />Bravely Default II’s boss battles are particularly great as well, especially some of the more challenging ones. It is user friendly yet stubbornly uncompromising, happy to offer a helping hand one minute then throw you to the wolves the next.<br />Much of the adventure spans just four regions, each with a city that needs saving, a handful of dungeons and various side missions as well. This game has amazing visuals with a combat system that both veterans and newcomers will love.<br />It has excellent characters with a rich in-game world, and delivers it with a majestic OST. It's not perfect but it's an excellent RPG that every Switch owner should try.<br />Overall, I recommend it and is fun to play.",

So trust me when I say, I love the series. HOW DID THEY MESS THIS FORMULA UP SO BAD?!?! We live in times where the properties from back in the day are getting sequels or remakes and they’re coming out in top shape! Streets of rage 4, Battletoads, TMNT…and so forth. The devs of this game completely missed the mark on what made the originals so good, First off for you to start and have 30 enemies on screen not letting you get past the first screen without dying a few times is a TERRIBLE first impression and unfortunately it doesn’t get better from there. The graphics are the selling point of the game, They’re definetly nice to look at, Other than that though it’s just poorly done. The game has no soul, The hit detection is off, The weapons have barely any impact, Too much going on at 1 time to even appreciate the art in the game, I honestly jumped back on the originals to see if I just remembered incorrectly, I beat the original game with only 2 lives lost. It took me 3 continues to beat this first stage, They really need to balance out the difficulty and the overall layout, It went from platforming fun to just frantic “where the heck am I on the screen” type of gameplay. It hurts to say that this is a hard pass until it (Hopefully) gets patched and updated, hard pass. 2.0/10",

If you like a quite soft touch keyboard then I wouldn't purchase this one.  This is a great mechanical keyboard that has so many different and unique options you'll be playing with different configurations for a while.  I love this style keyboard myself and wouldn't trade it for anything.  I had been looking for a good mechanical keyboard at a good price and this one was perfect.  This has the look and feel of a full mechanical keyboard with the benefits of a membrane keyboard.  I didn't realize this until I had gotten it and used it a while.  After realizing it I saw the uniqueness of it and how well it worked.  I honestly couldn't notice until I removed a key.<br /><br />I love the fact that it is heavy and feels solid.  The edges are sharp and can cut you if you aren't careful so this certainly isn't for younger kids.  I sincerely believe that this keyboard will outlast the next three computers.  It really seems that well built and sturdy.  I'm don't find the mobile phone holder useful but that's probably because I don't really use my phone in landscape mode and it has to sit on something solid to remain in portrait mode while resting there.  This is an amazing keyboard for the price and feels exactly the way I like a keyboard to feel.<br /><br />Just remember it feels much more like a full mechanical keyboard then a membrane one so if that is what you are looking for then this is defiantly it and you won't be disappointed!",

See the images I uploaded to see its size next to an ordinary cheap mouse! Beautiful packaging, this would make a GREAT GIFT, especially to someone who played a lot of PC games. It has four different tracking DPIs represented by the lit bars on top of the mouse. It's got EIGHT programmable buttons. The build quality overall is excellent. The cord is covered in a woven braid rather than the usual plastic/rubber. Lots of attention to detail paid in the design! It works great and it looks great!<br /><br />Then I tried to figure out how to program the buttons. The URL listed in the instructions goes no where. The Lenova website goes nowhere, and had zero trace of this product. Hmm. Sometimes I think the engineers and marketing don't talk to their web team. Anyway, I fumbled around for a good HOUR trying to find the drivers on Lenovo's website. Searches did nothing, viewing the product listing was also useless, especially because their website felt I was searching for a laptop and not a mouse. This was frustrating and baffling, which I'm learning is part of the Windows user experience. I've done information design and web design, and IT'S JUST NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO COMPOSE A FUNCTIONAL HYPERLINK, you know? Just a basic product list KEPT UP TO DATE, would have worked just fine. This is not asking for the moon. You want to sell these things, right? So make the drivers EASY TO FIND. If Lenovo would like to pay me $300 an hour as a consultant to tell them exactly that, I'd be happy to take the money. MAKE THE DRIVERS EASY TO FIND.<br /><br />So here I had this fantastic gaming mouse and could not find the drivers online in under an hour. I eventually stumbled across them. Why was this particular treasure buried? Why was the URL incorrect in the enclosed manual? Maddening. Frustrating and disappointing.<br /><br />The GOOD news is that this is easily the best mouse I've ever seen. Sensitive, ergonomically perfect, it looks cool, maybe a bit too cool if you're in a business setting, what with the somewhat malevolent glowing, pulsating light and all. Overall a killer mouse, second to none. Best of luck locating the hidden drivers online, however!",

This is a nice charger, and the micro usb makes it an easy to use accessory. I recommend this charger.",

Then I bought the Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum. These also failed as the microphone stopped functioning for no apparent reason. I decided to then go with this Corsair Void Pro. Works great at a cheap price and the original V2000's I bought in like 2012 are STILL WORKING. I don't doubt Corsair's quality and reliability.",

Its nearly identical to the SteelSeries QcK XXL pad (another very popular mousepad) except the Razer is very slightly larger in both length and width.  I like that Razer doesn't put any graphics or stitched borders on thsi pad, just a flat black cloth top with an unobtrusive logo tag in the upper right.  The lime green rubber layer on the bottom also gives this away as a Razer item and I think it adds a nice touch compared to the standard black rubber.  I definitely recommend this if you need a big mousepad for FPS gaming, I've been using these kind of pads for years and can't imagine using anything else.",

I didn't realize before how uncomfortable the elite headstrap was and now I'll never go back.<br /><br />This is designed for the weight to be on top of your head vs front or back as the elite strap did. It's SO much more comfortable. Also, the elite strap's pivot was always very tight, not to mention us being paranoid we'd break it--this one isn't. It's so easy to lift and lower the back, and it doesn't feel like it'll break.",

The screen was kick butt over the Rift, but I missed my Steam games and some of the Rift/S only (for now) games.<br /><br />If I didn't have a capable PC, the Quest would have been a no brainer (eventually, I would have purchased whatever I needed to make it comfortable). The S turned out to be everything I was hoping for. Comfortable as heck, smooth as silk gameplay, a beautiful screen which made the Rift seem blurry in comparison, and no longer a slave to sensors. I do miss the black level of the OLED Quest, but now I can sell off my old Rift. Still excited to see how the link cable turns out. I will always keep my eye on the Quest! One never knows....",

The mouse is good too. Overall, a 5-star from the person who has been using it for over a month now.",

                "text": "So please take this review with a grain of salt.  I really love the idea of this mouse - I LOVE the idea of the ring finger click button, but it the mouse just wasn't comfortable for me.<br /><br />For the past 14 years I've been using a Razer Naga mouse for gaming (WoW mostly).  My Naga broke and I thought I'd get something cheaper that had even more functionality.  I'm a woman and think I have average size hands - maybe even slightly bigger than average (I'm 5'10\") but this mouse was uncomfortable.  It's quite a bit wider than the Naga.  Because of the ring finger click key you really are only holding on to the side of the mouse with your pinkie.  The mouse is so wide that it was just an uncomfortable grip to move my pinkie finger out that much.  That being said, I might have been able to adjust to that except...<br /><br />I also had a problem with the side mouse buttons.  On the Razer Naga the 12 side keys are a bit more spaced out and they aren't angled into two different groups like this mouse.  The Naga makes it easy to seamlessly move between the 5 and 8 keys but on this mouse the 8 key is the top middle of the second group and you have to really move your thumb a lot to get it out of the first set of 6 into the 2nd set.<br /><br />Basically, it was just hard to overcome 14 years of using the same mouse and I felt like it would take too long for me to learn to use this one.  It's not the mouse, it's me!  It's probably a really fantastic mouse if you're not moving from a Naga.",

You basically roam around areas, fighting groups of demons, and try to recruit and fuse them to get more powerful demons to aid you. You can talk to demons to get items and recruit them but they might also ask for things from you or attack outright.<br /><br />This series, unlike Persona, is centered around grinding more than story.  I find it to be quite boring, actually.  You need to grind to find collectibles, grind for XP, grind to get items, and grind to fuse and level demons. It's just grinding.  The story is forgettable and trite.<br /><br />I got this game and played it for about 10 hours total. Then set it aside and will probably sell it. It's like the other entries in the series; if you love a boring grindfest, you'll really like this one because the mechanics are set up well.  If you want a story or some character development like P5, you are better off skipping this one.",

Battery life is amazing and will run on a single AA battery for a long time.

They make kind of a hollow clicking sound and there is a bit of what sounds like spring ping.  I'm sure most people don't care.  The switches can be swapped out if you have a little skill with a soldering gun, but it does not bother me enough to do so.",

Those are nice switches too; however, having experienced both blue and brown, I decided to try red switches. I type fast and needed an inexpensive but quality board that could keep up w/o too much noise. I purchased both the white and black boards with red switches (switches aren't hot swappable but keycaps are replaceable).<br /><br />The rgb is beautiful and bright on both boards. I replaced the keycaps with G.Skill crystal crown (both colors) and also bought a silver keycap set found on Amazon which intensifies the brightness of the rgb lights (see attached video) and creates a pretty quiet keystroke sound.<br /><br />I must say, imo, the red switches aren't much, if any, quieter than the brown but the key response time is much faster so I can now type w/o skipping letters. After 4+ weeks, despite not being a hot-swappable board, I can say I'm very satisfied. I'm sure there are better/worse products on the market but for the available features, various rgb options and price, this one is great.",

The game features enough new locations to explore to keep the player interested, and generally has high-quality graphics.  Recommended to fans of the genre.",

However, the white font is difficult to read on the function row, and I don’t love that the themed spacebar has “© Akko. Type Your Dream. Since 2016.” printed on it. There is an extra blank spacebar, but it does not have the leaf design.<br /><br />The keycaps are opaque. They are a little slippery feeling until you get used to them.<br /><br />The JDA profile seems to be one of Akko’s creations. There is a height comparison chart on their site, it’s slightly taller than Cherry. The row heights do differ. I took a comparison photo of R1, R2, R3, and R4 with a DSA keycap.<br /><br />F and J have homing lines, so does numpad 5. No other keycaps have homing lines for alternative layouts. The set includes a few 1u modifiers: shift, win, ctrl, alt.<br /><br />I’m using the keycaps with Akko Vintage White Switches, and they fit great.",

The build on these grips is sturdy which is always a bonus in this house when you have a kid that likes to pick at things made of foam or rubber, they have been able to withstand that.  The comfort of the grips is good, reasonable anyway, not too squishy.  The bar makes it easier for those really long challenging songs, but if you have ever played Beat Saber, or the like, then you know you never just stop at one song.  This assists also with those more complicated ones that help you advance in speed as well.  The set has a reasonable price tag too.  If you are looking for that extended bar set, this one will suit what you need for sure.  I do hope you find this review helpful!",

Super, super fun with the same awesome graphics from X and Y and an improved story from the GBA Gen III games. If I had to pick one or the other I simply couldn't do it. Alpha Sapphire you are fighting PIRATES aka Team Aqua and Sapphire was originally the first of the 2 games I got for the GBA gen Pokes. It will always hold a special place in my heart personally. HOWEVER if you want Nuzleaf or it's evolved form, Koffing, or Zangoose I'd say go with Omega Ruby instead. Of course just me personally I prefer Alpha Sapphire's Grimer and Seviper but as far as Lombre or Nuzleaf I'd say Nuzleaf all the way. Ruby gives you Latios while Sapphire gives you Latias so they are legendary clones but one is blue and the other is red. Whatever floats your boat guys but overall I like the whole experience of Sapphire better. A final not: Kyogre from Sapphire has the type advantage over Groudon. I don't use Legendaries myself but what is more useful overall ground or water? I'll leave that up to you, just remember Water affects all types but ground does not and if a Poison type or Ghost type has levitate that is a double whammy.<br /><br />CONS: They didn't bring back roller skates and you have to wait for your bike for a bit (as it was in the original R&S).",

                "text": "I agree with most of the reviewers… The headphones have good sound quality, plushy foam, not really snug on ears but since I don’t like things snug on my ears — bonus.  The one thing-to note is adding them to the elite strap makes them a permanent add-on since removing them is not convenient as it is a snug fit and you risk breaking the elite strap.  Finally, they no longer fit in the Oculus Quest 2 (OQ2) case and other cases for OQ2 like the Sarlar case which is bigger than most cases for OQ2.  This is a biggie for me.  I like to keep my OQ2 in a protective case when it is not being used.  Unfortunately most OQ2 case designs are compact.  So adding the elite strap, clip-on headphones, grips on controllers that add bulk, and keeping other cords, etc., finding a case is tough.  However, I found the “Vault by Pelican - v525 Case with Padded Dividers for Equipment, Electronics Gear, Camera (Black)”.  A little pricey in regard to OQ2 cases but VR headsets are expensive and it is easy to shell out lots of money for the extras so protection is important to me.",

Even when following instructions. I know right? I'm a dolt. :)<br />  This, however, was no the case here. The glass came with really nifty tabs to hold onto, allowing me to easily and accurately place it on the glass. Removing remaining bubbles was easy as well with the provided tool, just remember not to press the screen down hard before removing bubbles. I'm sure you still could but it'd be a more annoying process, I speak from experience.<br />  As for the hardness, and with it scratch resistance and overall protection, only time will tell. I can say that it felt sturdy when applying it.<br />  It's also VERY clear, you can only tell you have one on if you look to the edges and see the difference in height. I don't notice any change in perception of color at all. Overall I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Included are two screen protectors in thin foam sleeves, warranty registration paper, two packs of wet and dry cleaning wipes, microfiber cloth, little sticky doodles to remove dust just prior installation post cleaning if some happens to be visible, scrape-y card for removing bubbles, and an installation manual.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Easy installation, even for installation challenged users<br />-Comes with two just in case you mess up or have a friend in need<br />-Very clear<br />-Warranty is easy to register<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Can't see any as of yet. :)",
