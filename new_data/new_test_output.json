You then comb in the keratin treatment to each section of hair. I recommend wearing gloves. Allow it time to process and then blow dry and finish with a flat iron. Adding a bit of hair oil helped to restrain the humidity. For an at home kit, it is decent, but it is not as strong as salon treatments.",

It’s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I’m unable to find a full ingredient list. The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I’d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. 3 stars. Made in Korea.",

The key for the area that goes behind the ears is to position it so it’s not directly on the skin but more on hair.

The razor gives a super close shave and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. The only thing that makes me nervous is the handle. It becomes slippery in the shower so I can't get a good grip. It worries me that I will cut myself when I am shaving. I searched if the company sells refill blades for this but they don't have them.
