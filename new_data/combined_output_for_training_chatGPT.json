Unfortunately, they are super perfume scented, but the perfume goes away in just a moment of two in the bath. I used 2 in one bath and was disappointed that the scent didn't linger for much longer than it did. Especially since the description specifies that it would be great for sinuses! These are more for children who don't enjoy the spa setting as much and just want colorful tubs.",

This lotion has retinyl palmitate, which is especially risky mixed with sun exposure. This lotion seems best for evening use given that lavender can be relaxing and retinyl palmitate doesn’t mix well with sun. 4 stars.",

There are individual slide-in holders for each pair of tweezers and the scissors. The quality of the tweezers is outstanding. What I do is try to grad a single fine hair off of my arm. Each pair of tweezers passed the test. Another thing I like is that this set doesn't have a bunch of needless junk in it that just takes up room. This set can fit in my shaving kit without taking up extra space. Highly recommend.",

The twist towel is great, though. I didn't care for the hair ties and won't be using those. If you have longer hair and just want some twist towels, I would go with a different product because the cap probably won't work for you. But if you're hair is shorter, this set would be a pretty good choice.",

What I’ll do is I wipe myself down with wet wipes first then I’ll swipe these on my neck and wrists. These are so convenient!

It creates a smooth layer to put your base on. But, throughout the day the layer kind of breaks down and you end up with your pores showing. It isn’t rough or scratchy. It fills in fine lines and pores. And foundation goes over it great!",

I use an oil cleanser with them, and my pores are squeaky clean.<br />They hold up pretty well in the wash, I've had one or two loops come loose. I really like the wash bag they come with.

The bottles themselves are top notch - heavy duty glass, nice size that is easy to hold yet doesn’t require constant refilling. But it feels cheap overall. Other problems with the sprayer:  the screw on top fits pretty firmly, but the nozzle does not stay in place - it sort of swivels around. Overall the glass bottles are great but the nozzles need some work. It also comes with 4 black labels - the labels actually are sort of a thin rubbery material and seem really nice... but what the heck am I going to use to write on BLACK labels?",

There are two settings - a fine mist and a more narrow spray/mist. It also comes with nice blackboard style labels, two small funnels, and two screw on caps. Colored glass is needed for a number of liquids that you might have - peroxide, for example, or an essential oil blend. The blue in these bottles is just really beautiful, and combined with the black sprayer, creates an attractive bottle so you will be pleased with both the functionality as well as the look.

I pat some on all over face, neck and chest. Sometimes I do this a few times to saturate my skin. Then I follow up with other products (serum, moisturizer, and/or sunscreen). Ceramides help build and maintain a healthy skin barrier. Hyaluronic acid attracts moisture (but be sure to lock it in with a moisturizer or an occlusive ingredient). Sedum provides intense hydration & minerals, and vitamins to the skin. So lots of good stuff going on with this toner.",

I do wish this had more of a nice scent to it as it was kind of bland. It did the job well though, so I cannot complain much! My hair is a lot brighter and less brassy in the end and that is all I can ask for!",

It holds a little of 5oz, the mist very fine, handle is easy to pull, and it's a continuous spray for few seconds per handle pump! Might consider using on my hair in the future too!<br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions about my review, or if you have found it of any help to you.",

The mascara was a little pastey but step 1 applied ok and looked fine, but step 2 completely ruined my eyelashes. It looked horrible; The left side got clumped together and the right side looked like my eyelashes were growing baby eyelashes. Very unnatural looking. This claims to be flake free but after it dried i noticed a few little black specks on my cheeks. I had to use one of my old dried up mascara brushes to separate my lashes to fix them. It's also very hard to wash off.",

This was offered to me to try in return for an honest review. The packaging that the actual bronzer/highlight is in is made of some heavy glass like material. But, you get a beautiful golden bronzer and a peachy highlight. The bronzer actually looks very natural on my fair skin. It's not harsh or orange. I only use bronzer in the hollows of my cheek and jawline. This works really beautifully for my fair complexion but I'm just not sure I'd pay this price tag for a bronzer/highlight duo..",

I tried the little round pads with my makeup remover and it actually worked. It took off everything except my eyeliner which I don't know if that was the microfiber clothes fault or the fact that it was waterproof. I'm super impressed. It also took off my matte lipstick that's usually a pain to get off. Overall, these work really well at getting your makeup off and are so gentle against your skin.",

I own many quartz facial rollers but this one is high quality and well-made. It works similar to the ReFa carat tool but without the high price tag. It pinches your skin a bit when you roll it but that's necessary to improve skin circulation. In addition to anti-aging benefits, it's also great for smoothing out any moisturizer or makeup foundation you've applied and prevents caking. Overall it's a great tool and I love using mine with Sand & Sky gels and moisturizers.",

My skin is not very dry, so I imagine someone with dryer skin would need a much heavier lotion if using as a moisturizer. It does feel soothing and makes my skin feel smooth. I like the mild aloe scent. This is a value pack with 4 lotions in a set. I wish there was an option for a variety pack since it comes with 4 lotions. Overall, this is a decent lotion and is a great value.",
