It literally comes fully assembled, ready to be used right out of the box. The scrunchies are cute and functional! All the rage these days with youth. The only thing I notice that is different about this one than others is that it doesn't have the open cylinder at the top. Most of the others have an open top for bobbie pins and clips. And even better, it's the perfect less than $10 item for birthdays or gifts at $9.99 at the time of review.",
