Artwork plays a huge role in the game, so expect to spend a good amount of time scouring in-game paintings as clues to the killer's motivations and the degree of his twisted sexual fantasies.

While I'm not crazy about that, it does seem to work well. The song list is pretty good, though as with most of the Just Dance games, I only knew about half of the songs. To access all of the songs, you do have to subscribe to something. Long gone are the days when the purchase of the game included access to all of the songs.",

He says the graphics are good. There are missions to complete, but there is also an open game mode. However, if playing the open game mode, you can't end the game. He said it's similar to Just Cause as to the type of story line. He's played some games that he's been able to complete after a short amount of playtime. He has not played any of the earlier Far Cry games, but will likely go back and play them after this one.",

I have always loved the keyboard, because it’s so customizable, but have hated the lack of keycap backlighting for the uppercase symbols. By placing the number and symbol labels side by side at the top, both are properly backlit. The box of keycaps comes with a keycap puller, as well as with stabilizers for the larger keys. The instructions are very easy to understand, and swapping out the keycaps is a simple job.",

Most civilizations pay attention to ethical alignment and military might, and depending on how strong or weak a player's civilization can even incite a war.",

Unfortunately the plug end is just too short to use with the Otterbox case I have on the phone. The base of the plug hangs up on the edge of the case and the slightest touch rocks the plug out of contact. It worked ok with my tablet which also uses USB-C charging but I need one cable here in the back room to swap between devices and I'm stuck with the old straight cable.",

My only nitpick is that it's easy to screw up your ending if you aren't careful, and that after you complete the game, you do NOT get to keep your money like in the other Atelier games. But these few gripes didn't stop me from replaying the game three times in a single month ^.^",

NOTE:  To do this, you need a good charger. I've got about a dozen battery packs, and only one of them will supply this much power! That one is an Anker, but then again, so are 4 others that don't work. The PowerCore 20,000 is the one that works, but Anker has made several versions of this and I own two and the other doesn't work. So I guess what I'm saying is \"good luck!\"",

Some of the story lines it comes up with and missions you have to complete are quite funny. Overall, this game is enjoyable and will keep you busy for many hours.",

The fan is pretty quiet and has 3 settings (low, medium and high). Overall, he is extremely satisfied and gives it 5 stars.",

For the little PC gaming I do now the Basilisk has plenty Macro options and I love the Chroma effects which sync perfectly with my Razer keyboard. The slightly textured rubber grips actually give me better control than I initially thought they would. It glides super smooth which is due to the butter smooth pads, weight and the perfect soft flexible cord.",

The Rift S is dead! or wireless with ALVR like I said. instead of connecting to your local wifi network. buy a good USB 3.0 wifi dongle. and then create a hotspot network in windows withit. Conect to your hotspot via the quest and make sure your PC is wired to your network instead of wireless. But doing this will remove any network latency or traffic from your wifi. If you do this you can play ALVR wireless PC VR no problem!",

I could probably recalibrate it easily, but honestly, the problem isn't so bad that I have felt the need.

It’s a great rhythym title, A not so great kingdom hearts one per se as kingdom hearts has set the bar high to earn that title (minus a few misfires..KH3 DLC Im looking at you) all in all you won’t regret it!",

The game card flap then velcro's down to provide extra protection of the screen and hold the switch in place.<br /><br />All of the zippers are smooth. There's no weird plastic smell.

I was hoping for an extension of Animal Crossing, but this game was more of a foul ball, it just missed its target something fierce. Nine years later!!! I wish that \"City Folk\" had been even half as good as the original.",

That big wasted space on the map is creepy, makes me think of nightmares where stuff doesn't make sense. I never played Wild World and I was seriously unimpressed with City Folk.

Ridiculous earbud...one mind you. Ill give Xbox credit for actually giving us a real headset with the One. Graphics are very nice and no more diesel truck noises when the fan comes on like our ps3 does...sooo loud! Wish it wouldve came with a bigger hard drive too. LOU is almost 50GB...huge game!",

It's a top-down dungeon crawl with a bit more menu to work with. My personal favorite character was the halfling rogue. THERE IS BANTER! He's pretty much comic relief. I think there might have been a slight graphical upgrade too. 5 stars!",

The are OEM profile and have a pleasant sound. The case has zero tilt which was my number one requirement.",

This episode finds Nancy at a winter resort in Canada, trying to track down a dangerous prankster who has been damaging the resort's property and harming guests. There are several suspects, all staying at the resort, and Nancy poses as the new maid to try and figure out who is responsible.<br /><br />Generally this is a solid game- there's lots to do, and plenty of interesting scenery. The resort is not as inherently scary as some of the other places Nancy finds herself (like old mansions and dark graveyards), but there are lots of places to explore.",

The basic storyline involves searching through a mansion looking for evidence of spirits that haunt it. The scenes are quite bright and busy, and they are drawn in vivid colors. You have to move through multiple parts of the room to find everything you seek. Sometimes spirits escape and they fly around the room, which can be hard on the eyes. And really, that's my main complaint about this game. It has a good concept, but it was sometimes too loud and visually intense for me.",

These are solid build, comfortable and the foam area makes it really comfortable to use for extended play. Sometimes we play for 2 hrs at a time and that's a long time to play a game like Beat Saber, but these handles make it easier to do that, especially if you are having a competition. Definitely worth the money and would make a good gift to an Oculus user who loves the Beat Saber type of games. I do hope you find this review helpful!",

Most hidden object games make you find meaningless objects over and over in scene after scene that all look relatively the same. Not Dreamland. Each hidden object scene is very unique in appearance, and makes sense in the theme of the place. And the puzzles far outnumber the hidden object searches, which in my book is great. Very unique in concept, design, and execution.",

The main reason I think people are dissapointed in this game is the same reason for most games/movies of this league.....OVER HYPE! Some people who gave this game a horrid rating do not have an open mind either to this style of gameplay or the reality of the design of this game. If you like going solo go for Call of Duty 1,2,3, and World at War and maybe Call of Duty 4. And yes SCAR lovers I do feel your pain too.",

I only have Lego Star Wars for it right now but the 3D effect is awesome and the screen is so freaking big. The colors are great and when you actually see this in person you'll know what I mean. The blue on the system has a pretty metallic look. The weight isn't too bad but I am using it more for at home and in the car. But  this system is fantastic and the games out and coming out for it still are good. Its worth the buy. Enjoy and happy gaming!",

This game can be fun for all ages so long as children can read and understand financial stuff like your mortgage or rent. In  those cases this game is very addictive.

The AI ALWAYS tries to screw you and sometimes its impossible to even get trade rights (which is crazy). The whole thing is  SOOOO slow. The wait time in between turns are also insanely long.

Stealth kills truly are fun! truly the original sounds from the movies and creepy as hell at times! Tons of fun and challenging, super intense.

But, I couldn't in good conscience give this game the full five stars because of the problems with game usability. The realism and fun of the songs and dance moves are a solid 6 stars but the usability is a only worthy of 2 stars.",

I really missed playing this game. I also miss how far I had gotten in ps2 since, you know having to start over again. Oh well, either way, it's a fun game. My favorite racing game where I get rewarded for driving like a maniac and taking down rival racers! :) their music selection sucks though so I had to turn that off while playing.",
