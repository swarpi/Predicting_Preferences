Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.",

The lotion is creamy but lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin making my skin feel soft and hydrated. Very happy and for that price there really are no complaints.",

The wipes are great when you are out and about, they are good at getting sticky messes cleaned up. Everything has no scent and just feels really gentle.",

However, the model I received won\u2019t operate unless you are actually pressing in the power button. The water tank is the same capacity as my smaller, inexpensive sprayers and the battery doesn\u2019t last any longer. The Tiang spray feels quite harsh on my face. It\u2019s almost like you are getting hit with a high velocity blast. With my other sprayers you get this refreshing, gentle cloud of mist. The Tiang is practically just wetting you up instead of moisturizing your skin.",

The candle says it is soy wax which is nice but to me it smells terrible. The weird part is that the gift box comes with a plastic wine topper. Now the wine bottle topper \u201clooks\u201d nice but it is 100% plastic \u2013 worse than dollar store... It also comes with what looks like a random decorative metal key that serves no function and does not go with the contents at all. Thanks!",

(I attached a photo where even the wand itself is stringy.) The mascara doesn\u2019t dry in a timely manner either. Five minutes after applying the mascara and it\u2019s still not dry.

Poly Gel nails remind me a lot of acrylics, but are a little bit easier to apply, and you can get good length without having to use artificial tips. I've had relatively good luck getting them to last about the same length of time as acrylics, roughly 2 weeks. This set has some nice color options and seems to be high quality.",

Some of the oils and ingredients included are cloves, cinnamon, oregano, peppermint, parsley, eucalyptus, and rosemary. When dry, they were slightly powdery when I ran my finger across. They are slightly gritty feeling which I noticed more once the soap became wet in the shower. This could be nice if you like a slight scrubby feeling. I typically rub it onto my mesh bath sponge or silicone sponge so I don\u2019t really care about the grittiness either way.",

This fine mist sprayer is described as being akin to an airbrush. \"Works with serum, water-soluble toner, lotion, milk or mineral water for care spa. She was amazed at the power, it was noticeably stronger than any of the other nano mist sprayers. Almost all the nano sprayers just allow water.

The medication absorbscquivkly after removal and leaves my face feeling soft, smooth, and moisturized. Considering I use these three times a week, the 24 packnis the best value for my money. The last me for a month and a half without breaking the bank. For keeping clear skin on a budget, give these a try.",

So being able to have something like this in my purse is key. I also wanted it to have when out camping or doing outdoorsy stuff where you don't always have access to a sink and water. Until this, I usually carried wet wipes/baby wipes, but this is a more environmentally friendly option that I'm onboard with. I really like the smell, the feel, and the way it absorbs and doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky.",

Not sure, but this is a really nice rich dark scent that is heavier on the gourmand side than floral. This is for sure a date night scent.",

Nice and thick - hair is woven proportionately to the cap so it doesn't look clumpy in any one section. The cap is lace and has two adjustment straps on it. It even comes with two wig caps, a headband, some eyelashes, hair clips and a little atomizer bottle. Quite the bonus! The waves are really pretty! Since it has bangs, it even looks natural! Highly recommend! 5 Stars! Hope you find this review and photos helpful!",

It was very hydrating and felt cool and relaxing. The mask is thin and biodegradable. It actually drips off the chin area. With clean hands I removed the mask after 20 minutes and massaged the serum into my skin. I also like to use my facial roller to help my skin absorb the serum. The Oh, glow on sheet masks are very good.",

So, in the product photo, the nails with rhinestones are on the thumb, pointing finger, and middle finger. I usually prefer my nails with accents (like rhinestones to either be on the thumb and ring finger or pointer and ring finger, not the first 3).",

As for the dry areas around my chin, this cream did wonders. The flaking skin issues that I often have on my chin, were completely alleviated.

I like that the curler came with 3 soft pads, so I can replace as needed. I also really like this mascara. I look for mascaras that add volume rather than length and this one does not disappoint.

They are very glossy, and if you like bright colors there are some brights in there, but also pastels and earth tones. I kept the neutral ones and small of the more muted colors and am giving the rest to my 13-year-old niece who loves bright colors.",

The set was very simple to use and the finished results looked very high quality and have been lasting her for over a week so far. The one issue she had was the smell, but she says it doesn't last long. Overall, it's a nice quality product that even a beginner can use to get beautiful nails!",

This is a nice thick consistency but is still easy to spread and apply. It is mostly pure aloe vera gel and works very well to soothe and cover. This is a good value sized bottle and I expect it to last for quite awhile.",

The deodorant on the PF brand slides on thicker and isn't as hard as the Native deodorant so it would be easier to apply too much with the PF than with Native.",
